# Mira v0

**Mira v0** is a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) designed to assist researchers by providing answers **based solely on curated content**. Unlike typical models that draw from the entire web, Mira is **context-aware and scoped** â€” it only responds using a carefully selected knowledge base.

A key feature of Mira is its ability to **recognize when it does not have an answer**, redirecting users to the internal Molecule team for further assistance. This ensures both **accuracy and reliability**.
