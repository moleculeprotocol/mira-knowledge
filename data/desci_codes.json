The Project association is referred to as a \"DAO.\"\nStep 2: An LLC with C Corp election is established, largely by the same people who started the DAO, ideally in Delaware but could be any state. The LLC is referred to as a \"LabsCo.\"\nStep 3.1: LabsCo’s Articles of Organization provide that only members of the DAO may become shareholders of the LabsCo. LabsCo’s Articles of Organization also largely use “shareholder” terminology since it has a C Corp election.\nStep 3.2: LabsCo’s Articles provide that LabsCo is a \"crypto-based company,\" and so members of the DAO may stake their $TOKENs with the LabsCo blockchain protocol, which thereby creates \"Locked Tokens\" or \"L-$TOKENs\" for the Project $TOKEN holders. L-$TOKEN holders may provide non-binding advisory input on LabsCo proposals. L-$TOKEN holders may unlock and sell their $TOKENs at any time, at this stage.\nStep 3.3: LabsCo’s Articles provide that L-$TOKEN holders (who must be DAO members) may apply to LabsCo to get LabsCo equity in the following three share classes, which may be issued separately or concurrently, via one of the following methods, following each L-$TOKEN holder's successful KYC/AML screening and shareholder application:\n> Class A Preferred: Reg D/S/A/CF for crypto/fiat consideration, with liquidation preference, and possible participation, at LabsCo's discretion. The fact that Reg D would only be offered to known L-$TOKEN holders could open up 506(b), subject to further legal review. \n> Class B Common: Rule 701, for Employment Agreement for the team \n> Class A Common: Rule 701, for AIPP (Advisory, IP, and Promotion) Agreement for the contributor community.\nStep 3.4: L-$TOKEN holders who become shareholders use their L-$TOKENs for binding corporate governance, dividend receipts, and other corporate participation and benefits.\nStep 3.5: L-$TOKENs associated with LabsCo shares must remain L-$TOKENs for so long as the associated LabsCo shares are owned by the L-$TOKEN holder.\nStep 4: L-$TOKEN holders can sell their equity following the requisite holding period, when L-$TOKEN holders will be able to unlock and sell their $TOKENs.\n$TOKENs and L-$TOKENs were, are and always will only be technology to interact with the company with no associated rights.\nNotes:\n> Each share obtained requires one L-$TOKEN since each L-$TOKEN is used to vote the share, receive share distributions, and engage with LabsCo as a crypto-based company, but there is no formal correlation between $TOKENs minted and authorized or issued shares other than having enough L-TOKENs for desired shares. \n> $TOKENs and L-$TOKENs were, are and always will be only technology to interact with the company with no associated corporate rights, such as voting power or any dividend rights. They may have non-corporate benefits such as research, participation, product and discount rights granted by LabsCo and at its discretion. \n> Recommend Rule 701 grants are direct without vesting so 409A is not triggered, but vesting is optional across all share classes. \n> LabsCo is encouraged to tokenize equity, dividends, IP, and other company assets into RWAs since all shareholders are token holders, and it's explicitly a crypto based company. \n> LabsCo shareholders need not manage wallets themselves. For example, Class A Preferred could have LabsCo lock the $TOKENs on the Investor's behalf and vote the L-$TOKENs by proxy, off-ramp dividends, etc.\n[PreviousV2 Coin-to-Companychevron-left](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/v2-coin-to-company)[NextBioDAO Biblechevron-right](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/biodao-bible)\nLast updated 1 month ago\n",

The model addresses a fundamental tension in digital asset regulation, which is how to enable broad-based community participation and decentralized governance through token distribution without triggering securities law compliance obligations, while simultaneously creating compliant pathways for value realization through traditional corporate equity structures.\nRather than attempting to resolve this tension through novel legal theories such as relying on indefinite concepts of “sufficient decentralization” or temporal transformation of securities, the C2C model maintains clear categorical distinction between tokens distributed as utility or community instruments (the “coins”) and equity securities issued through established exemptions by a traditional operating company. Tokens never represent investment contracts; equity never dilutes token utility.\nThe model achieves this through a set of core design principles and mechanisms described below that implement structural separation, token locking as technical identity infrastructure, documented equity pathways, and governance arrangements that preserve utility while enabling compliant equity participation.\n**KEYWORDS:** Coin-to-Company, C2C, Digital assets, securities regulation, token offerings, DAOs, decentralized governance, Rule 701, Regulation D, Howey test, corporate structure\n* * *\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#i.-introduction)\nI. INTRODUCTION\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#a.-the-regulatory-paradox)\nA. The Regulatory Paradox\nSince the Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2017 Report on The DAO, [1] digital asset regulation has been characterized by what might be termed a “regulatory paradox”: the law’s ostensible hostility toward decentralization conflicting with its theoretical neutrality toward technological innovation.\nThe paradox manifests in multiple ways. First, the Howey test—articulated for decidedly non-technological investment arrangements in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., a 1946 case concerning orange grove investments [2]—has been applied with remarkable consistency to fungible digital assets, despite the profound structural and economic differences between orange grove sale-leasebacks and blockchain protocols. The test’s focus on “efforts of others” has proven difficult to apply in decentralized systems where no identifiable “other” manages the network, and where protocol improvements emerge from distributed developer communities rather than centralized management. [3]\nSecond, the regulatory response to digital assets has historically depended more on the specific characteristics of distribution arrangements than on the functional nature of the assets themselves. The same token distributed through a private placement to accredited investors might constitute a security, while the identical token distributed decentrally to thousands of network participants might be characterized as a commodity—despite fundamental economic equivalence. [4] This form-over-substance approach creates perverse incentives: projects are encouraged to conduct rushed, risky decentralizations rather than carefully planned network launches, simply to evade securities classification.\nThird, the historical regulatory approach has forced projects into false choices: either conduct an unregistered securities offering by raising capital through token sales, or spend years and substantial resources launching tokens through offshore vehicles and geofencing the United States, trying to achieve “sufficient decentralization” before further regulatory scrutiny, which is a threshold whose definition remains frustratingly vague. [5] A middle path enabling compliant community formation through utility token distribution while allowing subsequent, explicitly disclosed equity participation opportunity and traditional capital formation much like any other startup company, has been largely unavailable.\nThis regulatory environment has had concrete consequences. The initial coin offering (ICO) market, which raised approximately $13.3 billion in 2018, collapsed following sustained SEC enforcement actions establishing that most ICOs constituted unregistered securities offerings. [6] Subsequent token distribution approaches, including Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (“SAFTs”), demonstrated only marginally greater longevity. The SEC v. Telegram enforcement action established that pre-sales do not insulate subsequent token distributions from securities scrutiny if the overall scheme involves unrestricted public distribution. [7]\nCrypto projects have increasingly gravitated toward a dual structure comprising an offshore foundation (such as in the Cayman Islands or Switzerland, or as a Swiss association (Verein)) holding crypto assets for the unincorporated DAO of token holders, combined with a U.S.-based “LabsCo” or “DevCo” that performs all traditional corporate activity. This positioning allows the DAO to operate outside the jurisdictional reach of U.S. regulators, thereby minimizing exposure to U.S. securities laws and enforcement actions. Meanwhile, the U.S.-based entity functions as the operational arm, undertaking substantive business operations and programming, which equity is held by venture capitalists and the centralized, founding team. This separation aims to achieve a balance between operational efficacy and regulatory compliance, but has inevitably created friction between token holders who expect value to accrue to the tokens and the DevCo that has fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders. [8]\nMeanwhile, the unincorporated decentralized autonomous organizations of token holders and their often adjacent foundations and associations, have developed without clear legal structure, exposing participants to general partnership liability and creating practical difficulties in contracting, owning property, and conducting business operations. [9] Recent litigation has confirmed that courts will apply traditional entity classification frameworks to DAOs regardless of their technological structure, often with outcomes adverse to participants who believed themselves protected by decentralization. [10]\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#b.-why-prior-approaches-failed)\nB. Why Prior Approaches Failed\nUnderstanding the C2C model requires first understanding why previous attempts to reconcile tokens and securities regulation have proven inadequate.\n  * The ICO model treated tokens as equity analogues and therefore failed Howey analysis in practice. [11]\n  * The SAFT/pre-sale model attempted temporal bifurcation that Telegram rejected as a unitary offering. [12][13]\n  * The “sufficient decentralization” approach is vague, operationally difficult, and reliant on regulatory discretion. [14][15][16]\n\n\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#c.-the-c2c-model-as-synthesis)\nC. The C2C Model as Synthesis\nThe Coin-to-Company model attempts to address these deficiencies through categorical separation rather than temporal transformation.\nAt a high level: tokens (community/utility instruments) and equity securities (investment instruments) serve different functions and must be operationally and legally separated. Tokens provide community membership, tokenized utility, and technical identity infrastructure; equity provides investment exposure, governance rights under corporate law, and institutional capital. The same person can participate in both ecosystems, but via separate agreements and legal forms.\nThe design centers on the following core elements (presented as a stepper for clarity):\n1\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#dual-organization-structure)\nDual-Organization Structure\n  * A U.S. LLC with a C Corporation tax election (the “DevCo” or “LabsCo”) handles business operations, IP ownership, and equity issuance.\n  * A decentralized autonomous organization (the “DAO”)—ideally an unincorporated nonprofit association—organizes token holder community functions, receives voluntary IP contributions, and provides liability protection.\n  * The DAO holds no material treasury or binding control over DevCo; legal separation is maintained.\n\n\n2\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#token-locking-as-technical-identity-infrastructure)\nToken Locking as Technical Identity Infrastructure\n  * DevCo offers voluntary token locking (L-TOKENs) that act as cryptographic identity credentials and eligibility signals.\n  * Locking creates no automatic equity rights, no predetermined conversion, and no enforceable claim against DevCo.\n  * Locked tokens enable non-binding voting and forum privileges and facilitate KYC/AML for equity application.\n\n\n3\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#documented-equity-pathways-the-equity-bridge)\nDocumented Equity Pathways (the “Equity Bridge”)\n  * DevCo issues equity only through established exemptions and separate documentation:\n    * Regulation D (Rule 506(b)/(c)), Reg S, Reg CF/Reg A for investor sales.\n    * Rule 701 for compensatory grants to contributors and advisors.\n  * Token holders may apply for equity after locking tokens and completing KYC/AML, subject to DevCo discretion and documented processes.\n\n\n4\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#governance-distinction-and-voting-mechanics)\nGovernance Distinction and Voting Mechanics\n  * Token-based governance remains advisory for non-shareholders.\n  * When a locked token holder is also a shareholder, voting tied to that token may be binding per DevCo’s operating agreement.\n  * Only DevCo knows which locked token votes are binding (i.e., which locked token addresses correspond to shareholders).\n\n\n5\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#compliance-and-disclosure-emphasis)\nCompliance and Disclosure Emphasis\n  * Tokens are marketed and documented as utility/consumptive instruments in whitepapers and disclosures.\n  * Equity issuance is separately documented and compliant with securities regulations.\n  * KYC/AML requirements are applied prior to equity application/issuance, not to routine token purchases (subject to money-transmission rules).\n\n\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#d.-desci-as-a-primary-use-case)\nD. DeSci as a Primary Use Case\nDeSci (decentralized science) exemplifies why the C2C model is especially useful: tokenized participation can engage researchers, patients, and communities for research governance and data contribution, while equity enables institutional partnerships and capital formation necessary for translational R&D. Two illustrative organizations—DermaDAO and O'Ryan Health‑JDM—are used in Exhibit A to show C2C’s practical application in biotech and rare disease research.\n* * *\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#ii.-the-c2c-model-architecture)\nII.

Dual-Entity Structure\nThe C2C model integrates a DAO (community organization) with a DevCo/LabsCo (operating company) and assigns distinct, limited roles to each.\n**1. The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO”)**\n  * Ideally organized as a U.S. unincorporated nonprofit association (UNA/DUNA) under Delaware or Wyoming law. [20][21]\n  * Critical functions:\n    * Liability protection for token holders (statutory shield for UNA members). [23]\n    * IP assignment vehicle: voluntary contributions from token holders assigned to the DAO and then voluntarily contributed to DevCo to create a clear chain of title. [25]\n    * Interest-group/advocacy organization: non-commercial coordination and community governance input. [26]\n  * DAO should not hold material assets or perform business operations reserved for DevCo to avoid partnership or fiduciary exposure. [22][24]\n\n\n**2. The Development Company (DevCo / LabsCo)**\n  * Organized as a Delaware LLC with C Corporation tax election. [27]\n  * Provides:\n    * Corporate tax treatment and potential QSBS benefits. [28][29]\n    * Traditional governance to satisfy institutional investors.\n    * Full operational capability: IP ownership, employment, contract execution, equity issuance. [31]\n  * DevCo creates and distributes tokens as utility goods but ensures tokens convey no equity or financial interest in DevCo.\n\n\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#b.-token-economics-and-utility)\nB. Token Economics and Utility\nProject tokens (“$TOKENs”) are designed to provide non-financial utility:\n  1. DAO membership credential: automatic, revocable, and non-economic. [32]\n  2. Network utility: access to platform features, payments, governance participation, identity/reputation signaling—genuine, disclosed, and non-financial. [33][34]\n  3. Locked token functionality: voluntary locking creates L-$TOKENs for identity infrastructure and eligibility signaling; locking creates no legal rights to equity.

The Non-Option Nature of Locked Tokens\nLocked tokens are intentionally structured to avoid classification as options or securities:\n  * For options characterization, instruments typically need determined quantity and price and confer enforceable rights. [39]\n  * Locked tokens lack a predetermined equity quantity, lack a strike/exercise price, and create no enforceable right to equity—DevCo retains discretion over any issuance. [40][41][42]\n  * Precedent such as Gwozdzinsky and Lucente supports the design principle that fixed quantity/price and option periods are necessary for option characterization.

The Equity Bridge: From Tokens to Shares\nThe Equity Bridge maps the pathway from locked tokens to potential equity issuance while maintaining legal separation. High-level steps:\n  * Token locking (voluntary) for identity and eligibility. [50]\n  * KYC/AML screening for locked token holders who wish to apply for equity. [52]\n  * DevCo review and discretionary approval of equity applications. [54][55]\n  * Equity issuance through compliant exemptions: Regulation D/Reg S/Reg CF/Reg A for investors or Rule 701 for compensatory grants. [56][62][63][64][66]\n\n\nKey features of the bridge:\n  * No automatic conversions or formulas; approvals are discretionary and separately documented. [55]\n  * Equity issuances occur under standard securities law frameworks (Reg D, Rule 701), with appropriate filings and disclosures. [56][66][69]\n\n\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#c.-dual-participation-token-holder-and-shareholder)\nC. Dual Participation: Token Holder and Shareholder\nWhen a locked token holder becomes a shareholder, they occupy two distinct roles:\n  * As DAO member (by token): advisory voting, protocol governance participation, voluntary IP contributions.\n  * As DevCo shareholder (by equity): binding corporate governance rights, dividends, liquidation participation, statutory rights.\n\n\nRoles are legally separate. Locked tokens serve as cryptographic credentials for on-chain governance and to coordinate corporate actions, but legal rights derive from documented equity ownership on the cap table.

Exit and Liquidity\n  * Token liquidity: unlocked tokens trade freely as commodities. [78]\n  * Equity liquidity: shareholders face securities holding periods and restrictions (Rule 144, Reg S distribution compliance, QSBS holding periods, contractual transfer restrictions). [79][80][81]\n  * Upon sale of equity, associated locked tokens are typically unlocked to maintain the identity-alignment principle. [82]\n  * DevCo may tokenized corporate assets in the future (security tokens, dividend tokens), subject to compliance.

Securities Law Analysis\nThe C2C model’s central legal proposition: tokens are not securities; equity is. Analysis under Howey and related precedent follows.\n  1. Tokens fail Howey prongs in C2C because:\n     * Not a common enterprise in the requisite legal sense; purchasers buy a commodity/utility rather than pooling assets for pro rata returns. [86][87]\n     * No expectation of profits derived from DevCo’s efforts—value driven by network effects, decentralized contributors, and market dynamics; explicit disclaimers and utility marketing reduce investment expectations (Forman precedent). [90][91][92][93]\n     * Ripple decision supports programmatic sales and market-based value distinctions. [94][95]\n  2. Locked tokens are engineered to avoid being securities or options:\n     * Lack of fixed equity quantity and price; absence of enforceable right to equity. [97][98][99]\n  3. Equity is plainly a security and is issued only through compliant exemptions (Reg D, Rule 701, Reg S, Reg CF/A). [100][101]\n\n\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#b.-anti-money-laundering-and-kyc)\nB. Anti-Money Laundering and KYC\n  * FinCEN registration may be required if DevCo conducts money transmission activities. [102]\n  * KYC/AML is mandatory for equity issuance to verify investor status, maintain cap table integrity, satisfy tax reporting, and perform OFAC screening. [103][104]\n  * Routine token purchases need not involve KYC (unless other regulations apply, e.g., money transmission or exchange operator licensing), reinforcing token-as-commodity characterization. [105]\n\n\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#c.-tax-considerations)\nC. Tax Considerations\n  * DAO tax status depends on structure; designed to avoid taxable income by not holding material assets or conducting commerce. [106][107]\n  * DevCo elects C Corporation tax treatment, enabling entity-level tax, potential QSBS benefits for qualifying shareholders, and clean corporate tax identity. [108][109][110][111]\n  * Token sales/purchases treated as property transactions (capital gain/loss) under IRS guidance for virtual currency and property. [113][114]\n  * Equity grants trigger IRC § 83 analysis; Rule 701 grants have specific reporting and disclosure thresholds.

The Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA)\n  * RFIA introduces “ancillary assets” and recognizes decentralized governance systems, aligning closely with C2C separation principles. [116][117][118][120][121]\n  * RFIA includes safe harbors for gratuitous programmatic distributions but likely excludes discretionary DevCo-level distributions; C2C therefore relies on disclosure and alternative exemptions where applicable.

SEC Project Crypto\n  * SEC Chair Paul Atkins’ “Project Crypto” proposes a token taxonomy (Digital Commodities, Digital Tools, Digital Collectibles, Tokenized Securities) and affirms that many tokens fall outside securities regulation provided they are consumptive in nature. [131][132][133][134]\n  * Atkins also indicated investment contracts can terminate (supporting temporal transformations), and previewed tailored “Regulation Crypto” frameworks—C2C’s disclosure-heavy approach aligns with these proposals. [135][136][137][138]\n\n\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#c.-judicial-developments-ripple-and-lido)\nC. Judicial Developments: Ripple and Lido\n  * Ripple: S.D.N.Y. distinguished institutional sales (investment contracts) from programmatic sales (not securities) for XRP, providing useful taxonomy lessons for C2C distribution design. [139][140][141]\n  * Samuels v. Lido DAO: the court held an unstructured DAO could be a general partnership, exposing participants to joint liability—C2C mitigates this by using UNA/DUNA forms and separating DevCo operations.

CONCLUSION\nThe Coin-to-Company model offers a practical synthesis allowing projects to distribute tokens as utility assets while channeling investment capital through compliant equity pathways. It leverages established legal frameworks—unincorporated nonprofit associations, commodity/consumptive characterizations for tokens, and standard securities exemptions (Rule 701, Regulation D)—to permit domestic, regulated, and institutionally credible crypto-based enterprises.\nC2C does not rely on speculative legal theories of temporal transformation or undefined “sufficient decentralization.” Instead, it operationalizes categorical separation, clear disclosure, voluntary token locking for identity infrastructure, and documented, compliant equity issuance processes that allow community participation to coexist with investor protection and institutional engagement.\n* * *\n## \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#exhibit-a)\nEXHIBIT A\nDetailed C2C DeSci Use Cases: DermaDAO and O’Ryan Health‑JDM\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#introduction)\nINTRODUCTION\nThis Exhibit illustrates how two decentralized science organizations—**DermaDAO** and **O’Ryan Health‑JDM** —could implement the C2C framework to address regulatory and capital formation challenges in DeSci.

SKIN Token Structure and Consumptive Benefits\nCore principle: SKIN tokens are utility instruments, not investment contracts.\n  * Non-locked SKIN benefits include product discounts, early product access, research data access, participant recognition (NFT badges), token-gated content and forums, gas subsidies, and educational resources.\n  * Locking SKIN => L‑SKIN (voluntary): enhanced advisory governance privileges, priority access to data, eligibility to apply for equity. Locking is reversible unless equity is issued; locking does not create enforceable equity rights.\n\n\n#### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#d.-the-equity-bridge-from-locked-tokens-to-securities)\nD. The Equity Bridge: From Locked Tokens to Securities\nConceptual framework: locking signals commitment and eligibility; equity issuance remains discretionary and separate.\nThree primary equity pathways (summarized):\n  * Pathway A: Regulation D private placements (Preferred stock to accredited investors) — capital for product development; documented via subscription and investor rights agreements. [56][61]\n  * Pathway B: Rule 701 compensatory grants (Class B Common for employees/researchers) — equity for bona fide services; subject to Rule 701 limits/disclosure and IRC § 83 tax considerations.\n  * Pathway C: Rule 701 for advisory/IP contributors (Class A Common) — equity for advisors and contributors with IP assignment agreements.\n\n\nProcess for obtaining equity (operational steps) presented below as a stepper:\n1\n### \n[hashtag](https://desci-codes.gitbook.io/desci.codes/guides/coin-to-company-model/desci-coin-to-company-model-paper#kyc-aml-screening)\nKYC/AML Screening\n  * L‑SKIN holders who wish to apply for equity complete identity verification and AML screening to enable purchaser qualification verification and cap table accuracy.
