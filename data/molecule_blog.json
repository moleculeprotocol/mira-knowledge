Conceptual Foundation\nThese are the foundational concepts essential to understanding IPTs: \n  * Intellectual Property (IP): Rights to exclude others from the creations of the mind, such as scientific inventions, designs, artistic works, and symbols in commerce. \n  * Research & Development (R&D) Data: Findings, statistics, and other data gathered from scientific research. R&D data can be highly valuable and is often linked to IP.\n  * Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Unique digital assets stored on a blockchain. Each NFT carries unique value and specific information. \n  * IP-NFTs: pools of IP and R&D data rights attached to NFTs. \n  * IP Pools: pools of IP rights held by different owners to facilitate the licensing process, reduce risks of IP infringement, and encourage collaboration among innovators.\n  * IPTs: IP pool memberships. The rights and responsibilities of the holders of IPTs are governed by adhesion contracts, e.g. this one:[ IPT Membership Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iu3ALQzUa8LhIe4LIl972eGTfT296sWZZjGbtN4RbFA/edit?usp=sharing). \n  * Adhesion contracts: Legal agreements that attach to users of applications (e.g. terms of service and privacy policies) and token holders (e.g. the [CryptoPunks Terms](https://licenseterms.cryptopunks.app/) and the Milady [Viral Public License](https://viralpubliclicense.org/))  \n‍\n\n\n## 2. Tokenizing IPTs\n**2.1 Minting an IP-NFT**\nThe initial step is minting an IP-NFT on[ mint.molecule.to](http://mint.molecule.to). Minting attaches a legal contract, such as a sponsored research agreement that grants rights to IP and R&D data from scientific research, to an NFT. This IP-NFT denotes ownership of the IP rights on Ethereum. \n**2.2 Minting IPTs using the IP-NFT**\nThe next step is minting IPTs using the IP-NFT. The IP-NFT holder calls the Tokenizer smart contract, which confirms IP-NFT ownership and allows the owner to mint IPTs, fungible tokens unique to their parent IP-NFT creating IP pools. \n**2.3 IPT Membership Agreement**\nThe[ IPT Membership Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iu3ALQzUa8LhIe4LIl972eGTfT296sWZZjGbtN4RbFA/edit?usp=sharing) is an adhesion contract that defines the rights and responsibilities of IPT token holders in the IP pool: \n  * Governance: Token holders have the right to participate in the governance of the IP-NFT and its development. This includes voting on proposed licenses and use of proceeds from the IP-NFT. \n  * Access to Intellectual Property: Token holders can govern access permissions to relevant data and other IP or future IP arising from the development of the IP-NFT. \n\n\n  * Duty of Care: Token holders have a Duty of Care to honor, support, and adhere to the terms and conditions of the IPT Agreement, including any governance agreement made pursuant to it.\n  * Confidentiality: Token holders must not, without consent, use or disclose any confidential information or IP for any purpose or attempt to sell or register any Confidential Information, IP, or R&D data rights developed through their participation in the token holder group.  \n‍\n\n\n## 3. Legal Considerations and Best Practices\n**3.1 Governance**\nHolders of IPTs control the licensing function, thus governing the terms upon which IP and R&D data gets distributed. \n**3.2 Compliance with IPT Membership Agreement**\nToken holders encounter and agree to the terms of the IPT Membership Agreement so that it adheres to them at various stages: at the point of purchasing IPTs in the genesis sale, when voting on governance decisions, etc. \n**3.3 Dealing with Malfeasance**\nIn the event of a malicious actor, the IP-NFT owner and IPT holders can challenge the actor's right to receive any license or proceeds due to their failure to uphold a reasonable duty of care. \n**3.4 Seeking Legal Advice**\nLegal advice should be sought before engaging in the creation of IPTs and governance of IP-NFTs. This is a complex and evolving area of law with potential legal liabilities if handled incorrectly. For example, depending on how IPTs are sold, the seller may need to exclude US participants, limit the amount raised, limit the number of participants, register, and publish a prospectus or have a private placement memorandum. \n**3.5 Securities Law Best Practices**\n  * Know the Law: Despite their design as IP governance tokens without the hallmarks of securities, courts could still find that a sale of IPTs is a securities transaction depending on how the sale is marketed, so any prospective tokenizer and seller of IPTs should follow the relevant securities laws in any jurisdiction where they offer the tokens, engaging experienced legal counsel to help navigate the complexities. \n  * Prospectus and Disclosure: If the IPT sale is considered a securities transaction or IPTs considered asset tokens, then the seller may need to prepare a prospectus, whitepaper, or similar disclosure document. The best practice is to prepare a whitepaper anyway, which should provide comprehensive, accurate, and transparent information about the token, its rights, and the risks involved. \n  * Offering Exemptions: In certain jurisdictions, there are exemptions that allow people to offer tokens under exemptions that permit offerings without registering them or publishing a prospectus. For example, in Switzerland, a token issuer can make an offering to fewer than 500 investors or with a total value of less than $8 million in 12 months without triggering a requirement to publish a prospectus. In the United States, generally all token sales could be considered securities offerings no matter the token type, so people funding research with IPTs should comply with the _not-touching-US_ requirements of Regulation S, the offering size, marketing, and character of buyer requirements of Regulation D, and any other regulation applicable, e.g. Regulation A+. \n  * Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Regulations: Token sellers should comply with AML and KYC regulations to prevent illegal activities. \n\n\n‍\nAlways seek legal advice before proceeding with a token sale. This list is not exhaustive and does not constitute legal advice.\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/legal-guide-to-funding-research-with-ipts)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/legal-guide-to-funding-research-with-ipts)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/legal-guide-to-funding-research-with-ipts)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Now, we are about to hit hyperdrive by bringing together two of the fastest-growing projects in DeSci on Solana. \nOver the past few months, we have watched with excitement as [BIO Protocol](https://www.bio.xyz/) continued to put DeSci on the map — raising $45M in ETH and BioDAO tokens during BIO Genesis, securing strategic funding from [Binance Labs](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-in-bio-protocol-to-accelerate-decentralized-science-desci-funding-3820069547430728847?hl=en), and readying the next wave of BioDAOs focused on chronically underfunded areas like [Long COVID](https://longcovidlabs.org/), [Quantum Biology](https://quantumbiology.xyz/), and [rare diseases](https://x.com/endrarediseases). They've shown that decentralized communities of patients and researchers can unite onchain to advance early-stage R&D.\nMeanwhile, we have been pushing boundaries with pump.science: turning longevity research into a spectator sport. By letting anyone speculate (speculator sports?) on longevity experiments, we've shown how memecoin tokenomics can be channeled to fund scientific research. In the first two months, pump.science has launched two compound tokens, streamed four experiments, and seen the first two tokens ($RIF and $URO) reach a combined market cap of $350M with over $1.5B in trading volume — showing the world the true power of stadium science.\nToday, we're combining BIO’s BioDAO engine with pump.science’s experimental energy to hit hyperdrive, backed by three initiatives that will accelerate DeSci on Solana:\n‍\n## Our Commitment to DeSci on Solana\n### Strategic Partnership: BIO x pump.science\nWhat happens when you combine BIO’s proven DAO machine with pump.science’s experiment protocol? Magic. We are looking at ways that BioDAOs can leverage pump.science for each of their research areas.\nFirst up, pump.science is planning a[ collaboration](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0x01fdb4f1a1fa5dfbca0cd3a046740e752f05c221ae01be543987ad639988aeec) with [VitaDAO](https://vitadao.com/) in early 2025 to stream longevity compounds submitted as part of the [Longevity Prize](https://www.longevityprize.com/) and develop them into supplements, right on the platform. This will create a playbook for BioDAOs in the BIO Network to leverage pump.science for testing and validating IP in a transparent, community-driven way.\n### Ecosystem Support: Launching the DeSci Ecosystem Grant Program\nWe are supporters of BIO's vision, and now we’re doubling down. Using half (166M BIO) of Molecule’s [BIO allocation](https://snapshot.org/#/bioxyz.eth/proposal/0x0578c8e68ac9739f57eb2810648e7763de352d95d0d082284bf6ab4db9f652dc), we will be establishing a DeSci Ecosystem Grant Program. \nThe fund will accelerate bringing scientific IP onchain by supporting community-driven initiatives. By empowering researchers and funders to submit and fund new research ideas, the DeSci Ecosystem Grant Program will fuel breakthrough science and sustainable ecosystem growth.\n### Community Alignment: Backing Our Vision\nAnnounced at Solana Breakpoint 2024, Molecule launched [pump.science.](https://www.pump.science/) At launch, Molecule chose not to purchase any tokens ($RIF and $URO) in the spirit of the tokens being initially fully community-owned. To reaffirm our commitment to pump.science and the success of $RIF and $URO, we purchased $100k each in RIF and URO tokens. These purchases have recently been executed, and we are excited to be $RIF and $URO holders alongside the passionate pump.science and Solana DeSci communities.\n### What This Enables\nBy combining BIO’s proven model for BioDAO formation, pump.science’s experimentation engine and Molecule’s ecosystem support, you get the perfect recipe for hyperdrive acceleration that:\n  * Unites BIO and pump.science communities\n  * Powers BIO’s multichain expansion onto Solana\n  * Integrates with Molecule’s IP protocol to bring more scientific IP onchain\n  * Supercharges BioDAO growth on Solana\n\n\n  \nThis isn’t your old school science— this is research at Solana speeds. In 2025, BIO, Molecule, and pump.science are taking DeSci nuclear. \n‍\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/accelerating-desci-on-solana-molecule-pump-science-bio-protocol-team-up)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/accelerating-desci-on-solana-molecule-pump-science-bio-protocol-team-up)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/accelerating-desci-on-solana-molecule-pump-science-bio-protocol-team-up)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Funders struggle to discover and engage with suitable projects. In addition, IP is a highly illiquid, bureaucratic and opaque asset class that restricts virtual scientific collaboration through printed and filed legal constraints.\nDrawing on [original Linux metaphors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) and open source software. We live in a world where big pharma constructs expensive cathedrals over decades that serve their clerics’ interests more than they serve their followers. [+10 years to market, +$2bn in avg. development costs, coupled with an appaling failure rate](https://www.policymed.com/2014/12/a-tough-road-cost-to-develop-one-new-drug-is-26-billion-approval-rate-for-drugs-entering-clinical-de.html) — biopharma is a system with zero consumer choice and 100% dependency. We need bazaars.\n[The Cathedral and The Bazaar - Gitcoin Blog](https://gitcoin.co/blog/the-cathedral-and-the-bazaar/)\nTo address these challenges, we’ve set out to create an open marketplace that makes novel therapeutic projects discoverable, universally fundable and distributes ownership to patient collectives.\nDiseases have global networks of stakeholders: **Imagine a new insulin treatment funded, governed, and owned by diabetics**. Our marketplace connects researchers with patients to enable this.\n![open bazar for drug development ip nft](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62471165bb53be81d61075bc_open-bazar-for-drug-development-ip-nft.png)\nPhoto by [Francesco Ungaro](https://www.pexels.com/@francesco-ungaro?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels) from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-school-of-fish-near-coral-reef-3723505/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels)\n‍\n## Learning to Swim: an OpenSea for Biotech IP\nOver time, we aim to build a full-fledged funding ecosystem for early-stage research discoveries. Molecule is an [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) of biotech IP. Powering a new creator economy for researchers that allows for the rapid funding, discovery, and development of therapeutics through globally connected patient collectives. Virtual and sustainable. We believe this system will be equally beneficial to the current pharma industry as it will be for patients: by decentralising access and helping discover promising research more quickly.\nIn a first step, Molecule provides an interoperable Web3 marketplace leveraging a scalable legal IP to NFT framework. Our novel approach allows for IP to be virtualized and modularised in an open bazaar. To achieve this, we utilize a combination of unique digital asset identifiers (NFTs), novel automatic exchange infrastructure (AMMs) and governance structures (DAOs) to reinvent IP ownership, financing of these assets, and entity creation. Our tech stack allows therapeutics to be funded and governed in entirely new ways that leverage the decentralised power of open communities and decentralised finance (DeFi), as opposed to single centralized entities and corporations.\nWe began exploring the combination of IP and NFTs with DeFi in 2018. Fortune favours the brave.\nTOKEN BONDING CURVES POST\n**_Molecule has two layers — Molecule Discovery and Molecule Finance. Combined, they enable the creation of a vibrant ecosystem for decentralized modular drug development._**\n## Molecule Discovery — Making Research & IP Globally Discoverable\nA first objective on our journey is to accelerate the discovery of promising early-stage therapeutics and bridge the “Valley of Death” in academia. We achieve this by creating a platform for individuals and organizations to interact with intellectual property and data — the two core innovation drivers and assets in biopharma. On Molecule Discovery, researchers can make their biopharma assets (data as well as pre-filed patents) visible to a global audience, receive feedback and engage with potential funders. The platform allows them to list the details of their projects, specify the commercial opportunity and upload data assets on an interface that feels familiar. Inclined investors can discover and follow projects in areas of their interest, engage with the research team and ask for further qualification. When interest from potential investors reaches a certain maturity, the IP moves into a new licensing platform built on Web3.0.\n![open bazar for drug development ip nft](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/611e6b5daac87d5519e173ed_0_uCOWnY5EUyt7mmlG.png)\nFiltering for global longevity projects: A snapshot of 3 out of +250 projects on Molecule Discovery.\n## Virtualising Research On-Chain: IPNFTs\nThe evolution of the biopharma IP transactional landscape is happening in part via a class of digital assets called Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs). A new NFT standard, the IPNFT developed by Molecule, will unlock new value in biopharma IP through fractionalization, frictionless tech transfer transactions, and collateralization of IP in decentralized financial systems in a permissionless way. The art and music industry embraced NFTs by storm, its time we empower scientists. Molecule’s first use case for IPNFTs is in early-stage biopharma where university tech transfer offices (TTOs) sit on IP goldmines languishing in obscurity for lack of easy access to liquid global markets.\nOur platform enables these early-stage biopharma assets to be attached to NFTs via automated licensing frameworks and decentralised data storage systems like IPFS or Arweave. Once on-chain, NFTs can then be plugged into the broader Web3 and DeFi ecosystem to access price discovery and liquidity, financing and virtual drug development frameworks like DAOs.\nIn 2015, pioneering research in blockchain applications highlighted IP management and fractionalization as one of its key use-cases. Research collectives like [COALA IP and Ascribe come to mind](https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/slides/McConaghy-COALA_IP-short.pdf). Thanks to open networks like Ethereum and Ocean Protocol, technology, and adoption has matured to the extent that these early concepts are finally within reach of practical implementation.\n[NFTs & IP 1: Practical Connections of ERC721 with Intellectual Property](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d)\nThe type of IPNFT developed by Molecule consists of two contracts: a legal contract and a smart contract, which cross-reference each other. The legal contract is an IP license with language referencing blockchain transactions, addresses, and signatures. The smart contract is an NFT with code referencing the IP licensing agreement, obfuscating certain data components and storing them on decentralised file storage networks. Combined, the legal contract and the smart contract create the IPNFT.\n## Molecule Finance — Full Decentralized Modular Drug Development\nBut research projects and IP require an active team, community and funders to become productive assets. Molecule.Finance enables modular drug development by creating virtual funding and collaboration environments. NFTs can be moved into automatic market makers to raise funding, or inserted into DAOs managed as a portfolio in a specific therapeutic vertical. These structures mirror virtual biopharma startups or holding companies that consist of various global stakeholders, funders and researchers — but fully distribute governance rights to their community.\n![Molecule Protocol in a nutshell](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62471446408c33477df4e156_molecule-dao-protocol-in-a-nutshel.png)\nMolecule Protocol in a nutshell\nBuilding on the shoulders of giants: Molecule Protocol is built on a modular open stack, utilizing a variety of DeFi (Balancer, Gnosis) and governance components (The LAO, Moloch), as well as legal frameworks (OpenLaw).\n> _So show me, don’t tell me._\n‍\n## Introducing the World’s First Drug Development DAO: VitaDAO\n[VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/) is a decentralized collective funding early-stage longevity research. Its mission is to extend human lifespan by researching, financing, and commercializing longevity therapeutics in an open and democratic manner.\nVitaDAO and its members will own the intellectual property assets that result from the projects it supports. Molecule plays a critical role in enabling collectives like VitaDAO to fulfill their mission from a technology perspective.\n‍\nVitaDAO operates as a global collective and decentralised autonomous organisation on the Ethereum blockchain. But how do organisations like these actually hold intellectual property on chain?\nOne of the service providers to VitaDAO, Molecule, created a technological/legal framework that allows IP to be attached to NFTs and moved into the custodianship of VitaDAO, which can even create special purpose vehicles/legal entities for holding the IP.\nOur team helped negotiate and license the genesis IP for VitaDAO via an agreement with the University of Copenhagen, ensuring the DAO is able to launch with IP from a project from a world-class institution with a leading biogerontologist.\n[Meet Dr. Morten Scheibye-Knudsen: The Longevity Scientist and Founder behind VitaDao’s First Research Project](https://vitadao.medium.com/meet-dr-morten-scheibye-knudsen-the-longevity-scientist-and-founder-behind-vitadaos-first-5af8e674f548)\nBeyond VitaDAO, Molecule Protocol provides the following tools and software frameworks:\n  1. Asset-sourcing, asset-evaluation frameworks, and pre-clinical data hosting infrastructure via Molecule Discovery.\n  2. Custom-designed governance frameworks that enable patient collectives and drug development DAOs to hold, govern and interact with real-world IP via NFTs.\n  3. Funding frameworks via integrations into decentralized auction systems and AMMs like Balancer, Uniswap or Sushi 🐟\n\n\nIt’s early days and we are building this out via verticals - patient by patient. But the future of human health is at stake.

By helping to build the first biotech DAO - VitaDAO - and by creating core DeSci infrastructure like the IP-NFT framework we have laid the foundation for the next generation of builders in DeSci to emerge and reshape the life sciences. Through this process, Molecule and the DeSci community have learned a tremendous amount about building at the intersection of web3 and bio.‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6325f00ae9b813205739b98b_vdjnz4dlor5axzQRoFqiQx0GxVbCFHFc6SSV7xBOC-lvrz-yoWmqiDPC8TmhGzeqh5v59lVO5jjws8zDNgg-VI9eZO0sAcEtwZp_uX2lQ2skwRtjLO2ThPQodpnEAjcPWlVP0GYY8bcot5zg-QPbBbOmh6nVbt35Uh5hX8oXKiK_xVljQA3YNVt8YA.png)\n## Opening the Biotech DAO Playbook\nWe want to open-source this knowledge and are excited to share and scale our learnings and frameworks with the broader ecosystem by offering hands-on builder support and funding to ambitious DAO-builders shaping the future of decentralized science.\nBuilding a DAO in web3 is hard. Developing a value proposition and value accrual mechanism for DAOs is materially different from building a startup. Choosing the right technical infrastructure to build on can be daunting and confusing. Navigating the regulatory complexity of building a DAO is almost an art. Tokenomics and governance have evolved considerably over time and builders need to be constantly aware of the new DeFi trends and potential vulnerabilities.\nBuilding a biotech organisation is equally hard. Builders in biotech require significant domain expertise, a strong network, an understanding of disease areas and patient needs, knowledge of intellectual property and licensing frameworks, and a fundamental understanding of successful execution and commercialisation patterns in biotech.\nWe realised that building a biotech DAO is ULTRA hard. Simultaneously, we saw the immense potential that these new organisational forms hold for humanity. For the first time showing a viable pathway for medicines to be openly and democratically developed and owned.\n**Announcing bio.xyz** , a biotech DAO and DeSci launchpad that will fund and support future builders in decentralized science and biotech. bio.xyz will provide funding for DAOs working on a range of therapeutic areas and scientific domains, access to whitelabel frameworks and resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities. Our goal is to enable biotech DAOs to take full advantage of web3 and decentralized intellectual property frameworks like the IP-NFT, enabling them to fund, govern, and develop intellectual property emerging from universities, laboratories and biotech companies across the globe.\nbio.xyz will be governed and owned by its members. It takes foundational stakes in program DAOs and manages those via its community multi-sig. By committing to shared governance with the DAOs we support, our goal is to create shared public infrastructure for network effects across the DeSci ecosystem. Thus, bio.xyz is more than an accelerator for biotech DAOs and DeSci projects - it is also a tokenized DeSci Meta-governance layer, shared infrastructure, a DAO of DAOs.\n## Program Structure: A Petri-dish for DeSci Innovation \nFor builders, bio.xyz is an 18 week hands-on experimental program organized into 3 foundational milestones, culminating in the public launch of a series of new biotech DAOs. **‍**\n### Quick Facts\n  * 18 weeks of dedicated support from the bio.xyz network and Molecule\n  * Suite of technical frameworks and resources to get your biotech DAO to launch\n  * Shared governance rights in bio.xyz\n  * $100,000 USDC WAGMI grant\n\n\nOur community will provide you funding, regulatory support, technical support, community support - but more importantly: commitment to build. \nWe will strive to funnel the brightest and most committed biotech and web3 builders into our DAOs because we know that together we are going to make it.\n### Customizable modules on building a biotech DAO\nBuilding a sustainable biotech DAO requires deep domain expertise in both biotech organizational processes and web3. This first module will explore how biotech DAOs can generate sustainable value accrual mechanisms through building IP portfolios and networks of researchers and how these mechanisms form a symbiosis with web3 tokenomics, governance, and organizational design.\n### DAO Legal Defense Protocol\nWe help demystify the most complex elements of starting a DAO, such as important regulatory questions and hurdles, implementing a DAO legal defense protocol and tooling that helps simplify everything from incorporation, structuring, contract signing, and IP-NFT integration.\n### Technical IP-NFT Integrations\nIntellectual property is the core value driver in sustainable biotech DAOs. We provide everything you need to mint, transfer, and sell IP-NFTs using the Molecule tech stack. \n### Governance and Operations Support\nWe provide proven governance frameworks, battle-tested for success. We help simplify DAO operations and accounting through a network of frameworks and operators. \n### Community Building\nWe help you go from 0 to 1000 with the right tools and people, and a special focus on helping you build a strong network of academics relevant to your therapeutic or scientific area of interest.\n### Dealflow Process Implementation\nWe turn sourcing, evaluation, and dealmaking into a standardized and replicable process with custom tools and whitelabelled frameworks for deal flow management, standardized agreements, and licensing and negotiation support. \n### Custom Tokenomics, Incentive Programs, and Fundraising\nWe design and enable sustainable token economies for long-lasting scientific organizations, plus access to visionary and patient capital from our network. \n### Plugging into Web3 and DeFi\nWe provide liquidity avenues, partnerships and awareness to make sure your DAO is web3-compliant and cutting edge. **‍**\n### Branding and Design\nBranding and identity are key to communicating a credible and reputable organization. Our network of designers and brand identity experts will help you create the best possible identity for your organization to cultivate a sense of trust and professionalism with researchers and your broader community.\n### WAGMI Grant and Milestones\nWe provide DeSci DAOs with a $100,000 USDC on-chain WAGMI grant into a multi-sig wallet on Ethereum controlled by members of your founding team and members of bio.xyz. Every 6 weeks, 1/3 of the grant is automatically released provided your DAO meets measurable (in some cases on-chain) milestones set upon grant issuance.\nA portion of the grant converts into your DAO’s governance tokens issued to bio.xyz so that members of bio.xyz can vote in your DAO, helping to ensure your DAO’s ownership is decentralized from day zero.**‍ _  \n_**\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6325f00ac5878595add8c3f5_65XnDsqZXEtIeM_Pnra1-bp1mUxErc6jnx06d6pd0Ka1Jn8us5z-Qq-i-bBaUG4S5TsOqhgV3pY6TVkTgEmZU4MoQNnQn40HsicXYvb3zKJ55ImZDX8rsCZXp7b-p2CYXi5X55fJYw9gt9gxqR48V0ZREUxnYDEuiDFs-wJTBItqYIzNilanOuoM8w.png)\n## First Cohort\nThe program will operate in cohorts of 4-5 biotech DAOs.

Recently, in an unprecedented effort, a large-scale study employing advanced machine learning methods analyzed medical records from over 4 million individuals in the Danish Health System’s medical and prescription records. The study, consisting of over 1.4 billion prescriptions, found that a number of prescription drugs were highly associated with longer life- and health-span in long-live populations. VitaDAO seeks to validate these observations through a series of carefully conducted wet-lab experiments. If successful, this work could result in the repurposing of several FDA-approved therapeutics for the purpose of extending the human lifespan, at a lower cost and over faster timelines than conceivably possible with de novo drug discovery.\nThis program focuses on testing and developing three of these small molecules as possible interventions in ageing. Specifically, we will test the drugs on human cell cultures and in fruit flies, before moving to mice in the future. These molecules target the longevity field with the aim of letting everyone live healthier, happier and longer lives.\n‍\n## ‍  \nResearch Background\nTo date, more than a hundred compounds have been shown to extend the lifespan of model organisms. In humans, no drug is currently recognized to extend lifespan. Given the large diversity of drugs able to extend the lifespan of model organisms, it is likely that multiple drugs are able to extend the healthspan of humans. But how do we find these compounds?\nThe Scheibye-Knudsen lab has analyzed 1.5 billion prescriptions from 4.8 million individuals over 40 years in The Danish National Health Service Prescription Database and correlated this with the survival of individuals prescribed certain drugs. They received exclusive access to carry out this work. The Scheibye-Knudsen Lab has identified 10+ FDA approved medications that appear to have a strong effect on lifespan following analysis. This project will focus on optimising, repurposing, and re-formulating the 3 drugs with the strongest effect on human lifespan. Additionally, there is a database of compounds that could be pursued. The identities of the molecules are not disclosed in this presentation to protect the full viability of the intellectual property. They are referred to as X, Y, and Z.\n[View project on Molecule Discovery.](https://discover.molecule.to/project-details/the-longevity-molecule-1603031933959x305091127349719700)‍\n## ‍**About Morten Scheibye-Knudsen**\nMorten Scheibye-Knudsen is Associate Professor and group leader at the Center for Healthy Aging, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

This funding led to the creation of in vitro assays and the development of 15 potential drug candidates. \nSince then, the VitaDAO community has further supported Artan Bio through a successful crowdsale of IP Tokens, raising an additional $300,000 USD in 10 days _(_[_token ticker: $VitaRNA_](https://www.vitarna.xyz/) _)._. The goal of these funds was to find and further develop lead drug candidate(s) via _in vitro_ assays, package candidates into a drug delivery modality, and then move them into animal models to assess efficacy. Of the 15 drug candidates that were developed, at least 2 showed some promise in correcting nonsense mutations in the cell line used in the experiments. Let’s explore their approach and review the findings in detail.\n‍\n## What Is a DNA Mutation?\nTo start, let’s give some background on DNA mutations. DNA mutations are changes or \"mistakes\" in our DNA, the molecule that carries the instructions for building and maintaining our bodies. Think of DNA as a recipe book that contains all the information needed to create proteins, the building blocks that make up our cells. A mutation is like a typo in this recipe book—sometimes it’s harmless, but other times it can cause serious problems by producing a faulty protein or no protein at all.\n#### Types of DNA Mutations\nThere are several types of DNA mutations. Some of the most common include:\n  1. **Silent Mutations** : These mutations do not change the final protein produced, so they often go unnoticed.\n  2. **Missense Mutations** : These mutations change one of the \"letters\" in the DNA, which can result in a different protein being made.\n  3. **Nonsense Mutations** : Nonsense mutations create a premature “stop” signal (codon) in the DNA. Imagine reading a sentence, and suddenly there is a period in the middle of a word. The result is an incomplete protein that doesn’t work correctly or at all. These mutations are the focus of Artan Bio.\n\n\n#### Nonsense Mutations and Codons \nTo understand nonsense mutations better, we need to know about codons. Codons are like words in the DNA language. Each codon consists of three DNA \"letters\" (nucleotides) that tell the cell which amino acid (building block of protein) to add next.\nOne important codon is **CGA** , which instructs the cell to add the amino acid **arginine**. Nonsense arginine mutations are common in proteins related to DNA damage, neurodegeneration, and tumor suppression. **_The Artan BIO team is specifically focused on restoring protein levels and function for arginine nonsense mutations to treat age-related diseases._**\n‍\n## Targeting Mutations for Treatment: Viruses to the Rescue\nResearchers at Artan Bio are focused on finding ways to correct these CGA nonsense mutations to restore healthy protein levels. To correct these mutations, the researchers are using a **gene therapy** approach, which involves delivering a healthy copy of the gene directly into cells to replace or repair the faulty one. Artan Bio is using what’s called a “suppressor tRNA” system which is able to recognize the mutation in DNA letters, and inserts the correct letter in its place. To do this, we can use the skills of an old enemy-turned-friend: adenoviruses.\n#### What Are Adenoviruses and Why Are They Used in Treatments?\nImagine you need to deliver a very important package to a specific address. You could try many different delivery methods, but you’d probably choose the most reliable one that reaches the most places. In medicine, when scientists need to deliver a new gene or treatment directly into cells, they can use a “delivery vehicle” called a **vector** —and that’s where adenoviruses like **AAV9** come in.\nAdenoviruses are a type of virus that usually cause mild illnesses, like the common cold. However, scientists have found a way to turn them into helpful tools for delivering treatments. **AAV9** (Adeno-Associated Virus 9) is a special type of adenovirus that is FDA approved, and has been modified in the lab to remove its ability to cause disease. So, while AAV9 is technically still a virus, it’s like a harmless delivery truck that can carry helpful genetic instructions into the cells.\n‍\n## How Is Artan BIO Using AAV9 Vectors in Their Treatment?\nIn gene therapy, scientists use AAV9 to deliver healthy copies of a gene into cells to replace or fix faulty genes that cause diseases. In the case of Artan Bio, the virus is used to carry and deliver their engineered suppressor system that specifically recognizes nonsense mutations in CGA codon to restore normal protein levels and function.\n#### Tools to measure that a treatment is working\nTo make sure their gene therapy approach is effective, Artan Bio is using several tests to measure the important variables.\nOne key test is a **Western blot** , which allows scientists to answer questions like\n  1. Is a certain protein present in a sample (yes/no)\n  2. At what level is that protein expressed, and how does it compare to a healthy vs diseased state (how much)\n\n\nIn the current data, p53 (a key protein involved in tumor suppression), is measured in a cell line that carries the arginine nonsense mutation of interest (Calu-6 cells). The cells naturally carry this mutation, so if you leave them to grow on their own, they will not produce the full p53 protein since the mutation is blocking this process. However, if you add a virus carrying Artan Bio’s suppressor system to the cells, it looks like some of the tested conditions were able to “suppress” the mutation and restore the cells’ natural ability to produce the protein - a successful initial result! Let’s take a look at the results more deeply to understand how the researchers were able to draw these conclusions.\n‍\n## Artan Bio In Vitro Results\n#### Results 1:\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66f51cd54db9d5d8239964f4_66f51c9c30176dda5a64ba5f_Screenshot%25202024-09-26%2520at%252010.34.13.png)\nIn their tests, Artan Bio designed several vectors to rescue an arginine nonsense mutation in p53 in the Calu-6 cell line. Of the 5 vectors tested, 2 showed positive results for rescuing p53 protein levels (lanes 4 and 5 in the image above; labels Vec2 and Vec3). These results are from a technique called a “Western blot”, and the darkness of the band is indicative of how much protein is present (darker band = more protein). These results show that the suppression vectors that have been created by Artan Bio are able to increase p53 protein production in the tested cell line. \nThe important thing to note here is that these vectors can be effective **_if_** they are able to get into the cell. This is easy to test and control for in cells tested in the lab, but the methods here cannot be used to treat people. In order for the vector to reach where it needs to go in humans, it needs to be packaged into its delivery vehicle. This is where the AAV9 virus comes back in. Therefore, the next thing to test for was the ability of the AAV9 virus to enter the same cell line, showing that (1) it would be capable of delivering the vector cargo and (2) the vector cargo could then go on to increase p53 protein production. \n#### Results 2: Confirmation that AAV9 carrying vector cargo can enter Calu-6 cells and increase p53 protein production\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66f51cd54db9d5d8239964f9_66f51cc3981a7f56c898a343_Screenshot%25202024-09-26%2520at%252010.35.03.png)\nAs always, optimization steps are needed before the “real” experiment can start. As mentioned, the team needed to see what concentration of virus would be required to get the cargo into the cell. Too little, and not enough cargo will be delivered. Too much, and the virus will cause too much toxicity and kill the cells. This relationship is referred to as the multiplicity of infection, or MOI, which is the ratio of infectious agents (AAV9 virus here) to infection targets (the target cell, here Calu-6 cells). \nIn this first experiment, two conditions were tested (Artan-101 and Artan-102). Cells had virus added to them at two different concentrations to assess which combination of virus concentration and vector would be the most effective at restoring levels of p53 protein. Positive results were obtained in lanes 4 and 6 in the image above, with the most effective condition being seen in lane 6, with a very strong band visible for p53. \nConclusion: The suppressor system (vector), when packaged into the virus, can enter cells and effectively overcome the nonsense mutation to restore the production of the p53 protein in the tested cell line.\n‍\n## What’s Next for Artan Bio’s Research?\nWith these promising results, the next steps involve scaling up the production Artan-102, the lead candidate, and more extensive studies in animals. Artan Bio will submit a proposal to VITARNA tokenholders to support the feasibility study. This will produce high-quality material sufficient for safety and efficacy studies; critical experiments are needed before testing in humans is possible. If all goes well, this innovative approach could one day help treat or even cure diseases caused by DNA mutations, such as neurodegeneration and cancer.\n‍\n## What Artan Bio Means for DeSci?\nWhile still in its early stages, Artan Bio embodies more than just research advancements— it is proof that decentralized communities can come together to quickly fund and advance innovative research that otherwise would have laid dormant. By using new technologies to democratize funding and create new incentive mechanisms, Artan Bio has not only advanced our scientific understanding of mutations in aging but has moved us one step closer to the transparent and inclusive vision of decentralized science. \n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/artan-bio-advances-nonsense-mutation-research-through-democratized-funding-via-molecules-intellectual-property-protocol)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/artan-bio-advances-nonsense-mutation-research-through-democratized-funding-via-molecules-intellectual-property-protocol)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/artan-bio-advances-nonsense-mutation-research-through-democratized-funding-via-molecules-intellectual-property-protocol)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

While the term ‘biological clock’ gets thrown around loosely, the reality is that very few people are educated about or prepared for the fertility issues that can ensue. \nOvarian aging is a multi-step process, culminating in menopause, and a complete inability to bear children. The trait is governed by several factors including age, genetics, lifestyle, health conditions, medical treatments, and weight - simply put, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ model. Countless women are sent home from fertility doctors with deep emotional, physical and financial wounds, but no answers as to _why_ they are struggling to fall pregnant. [AthenaDAO](https://www.athenadao.co/) exists to advocate for all those impacted by reproductive decline (among other things) and is vivaciously pursuing solutions.\nEstimates suggest that [one in six](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infertility#tab=tab_1) people experience fertility issues during their lifetime. Dr Mario Cordero and his wife formed part of this number; after suffering problems in conceiving due to ovarian aging the two had to turn to fertility treatments. Their story ended happily with a beautiful daughter named Martina, but the experience roused something in Mario, leading him to dedicate his life to the field of ovarian aging. Having been at the final stages of the fertility treatment pipeline, Mario understands that the work done in a laboratory needs to be able to be transported out of a petri dish and to patients, in order for it to make a recognisable impact in peoples’ lives. It is this sentiment that rang true to AthenaDAO, which primarily focuses on funding **translational** research to improve the female experience. AthenaDAO has dedicated $120 000 to Mario and his work with [Pablo de Olavide University](https://www.upo.es/portal/impe/web/portada/index.html) to combat ovarian aging. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/64c39d6e1b258e0cbaa76e6e_IMG_20191009_1742273.jpg)\n_Dr Mario Cordero in his lab in Seville, Spain_\n### The Role of Inflammation in Ovarian Aging\nChronic inflammation is hugely detrimental to our health. In fact, it is one of the infamous and well-recognized ‘[Hallmarks of Aging’](https://www.aging-us.com/article/204248/text) which detail the primary risk factors that result in a bodily decline. Unsurprisingly, inflammation in the ovaries is dangerous yet frequently overlooked. It is a cause of a Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR), which renders women infertile. \nAs a recognized expert in the field of inflammation in reproductive longevity, the funding from AthenaDAO will allow Mario to tackle the **root** of inflammation responsible for a diminishing ovarian reserve, via the inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway. Using state-of-the-art animal models and having access to patient tissue samples, Mario's research group is exceptionally positioned to develop novel inhibitors as a tailor-made treatment opportunity for women in need. As [Laura Minquini](https://twitter.com/LauraMinquini), Core Lead of AthenaDAO says; “If you understand the pathways of ovarian aging, you have the potential to treat them.” \nMario brings with him a history of excellence; he has published 90 articles, 8 book chapters, 2 books, 5 patents, and has been cited more than 8993 times. \n### Utilizing Blockchain for Progress\nAthenaDAO has a keen focus on funding translational research that will generate novel intellectual property, which is why this particular project was appealing. Mario has clear, well-structured endpoints with a thorough consideration of how his research will be translated in the future. By utilizing Molecule’s technology, AthenaDAO has been able to bind the intellectual property, underlying data, and economics into one programmable, transactable, digital unit - **an IP-NFT**. This creates an immutable history of the project as time goes by, and a mechanism that allows participants to directly govern the IP produced by Mario’s project, and future projects. \n> _It’s totally new for me but [I’m] really happy because I see it as an enriched experience. The project is going step-by-step because I have comments from the reviewers which help improve the proposal. We all want the same; to get future treatments to help people._\n> _Dr Mario Cordero_\n### The IP-NFT Artwork\nAthenaDAO commissioned [Hanna Salmonowicz](https://twitter.com/HSalmonowicz) to create the sculpture for their landmark [Reproductive Health Report](https://www.athenadao.co/reproductive-health-report). They decided that given the strength of the piece and because of narrative it made sense to the artwork for their first IP-NFT. Hanna is both an artist and an aging scientist - a perfect fit for the project. Inspired by oocytes, Hanna used small handmade plasticine shapes and beads to form the sculpture.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/64c3963fb1a2e59bd5c20e0d_ATHENA_DAO_-_IP_NFT_-_01_-_HANNA_SALMONOWICZ_550%20\\(1\\).png)\n### Ready, set, whitelist! \nAthenaDAO’s scope extends far beyond fertility.

Not only was the preliminary science promising, but Dr. Cordero's own journey through fertility struggles, combined with his genuine desire to connect with the community he aimed to serve demonstrated a clear alignment in values. Since then, Dr. Cordero has been hard at work generating data, and we’re happy to let you know that things have gone well! \nIn order to continue this important work, Dr. Cordero, together with AthenaDAO, is looking to the community for support in raising $75k to fund the next milestones. Before we look too far ahead, we thought we’d walk you through the most recent results. \n‍\n## Fertility 101\nFertility often influences major life decisions and future planning. Estimates suggest that[ one in six](https://www.who.int/health-topics/infertility#tab=tab_1) people experience fertility issues during their lifetime - a challenge that people usually bear privately behind closed doors, feeling isolated and confused. With no clear biomarkers to indicate how many eggs a woman has or how much time she has left to conceive, decisions about family planning can feel like a race against an invisible clock. This isn’t just about reproduction—it’s about choice. The ability to make informed decisions about when to start a family, or whether to start one at all, is crucial for many women. Even beyond fertility, ovarian aging also impacts the onset of menopause, a life-altering transition that many women may be unprepared for.\n‍\n## What is Ovarian Aging?\nOvarian aging is the gradual decline of the processes that maintain fertility over time. As women age, their ovarian reserve—the number of viable eggs—naturally diminishes. But this decline isn’t the same for everyone. Some women experience a faster depletion, known as diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), where fertility declines earlier than expected. This can lead to fewer reproductive options for those affected.\nAt birth, women have around 1-2 million eggs, but by the time they reach menopause (around age 51), only about 1,000 remain. The most significant drop in egg quality and quantity occurs between the ages of 35 and 40, contributing to reduced fertility, a higher risk of miscarriage, and an increased chance of genetic issues in embryos. Globally, millions of women are affected by this decline, with many experiencing these challenges well before the average age due to conditions like DOR.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66ffee9e74da7e7eaf131d7a_66ffee54bde1060f7d2f1c75_Screenshot%25202024-10-04%2520at%252015.31.47.png)\n_Figure 1: Ovarian Reserve Diminishes throughout a woman’s lifetime_[1]\nFactors that can cause ovarian aging to occur prematurely include genetics, autoimmune disorders, certain medical treatments (like chemotherapy), and environmental exposures. These influences can fast-track the decline, often leading to fertility challenges in women as early as their late 20s or early 30s.\nUnderstanding ovarian aging is vital for women who want to take control of their fertility and make informed choices about their future. It’s also crucial for the doctors and specialists who support them in navigating these deeply personal decisions. By recognizing the signs early and raising awareness, we can help women explore their options sooner and find ways to preserve their fertility for when they’re ready.\n‍\n## Tracking Ovarian Health\nOne key biomarker often used to track ovarian health is Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), a hormone produced by cells in the ovary. As the ovarian reserves drop, so do the AMH levels, providing insights into how quickly time is catching up with a woman’s reproductive ability. But AMH isn’t the only clue! Another key hormone, Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), rises as the ovaries become less responsive to its signals, consequently, prompting the brain to pump out more FSH in an attempt to maintain fertility. This ultimately leads to a cycle of increasing FSH levels, indicating a declining ovarian reserve and reduced fertility, which results in fewer healthy follicles developing into viable eggs. In addition, these hormonal changes don’t happen in isolation. The ovaries themselves also undergo structural changes, leading to fewer healthy follicles developing into viable eggs. Together, these biomarkers form a roadmap of ovarian aging, one that researchers like Dr. Mario Cordero are actively working to understand, in an effort to uncover novel treatments. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66ffee9f74da7e7eaf131d87_66ffee7aec85dd2862a38091_Screenshot%25202024-10-04%2520at%252015.32.30.png)\n_Figure 2. AMH is produced by specialized cells called granulosa cells in the ovarian follicle_[2,3]\nUntil now, the process of ovarian aging has seemed like a predestined path, unable to be disrupted. However, what if there were ways to change direction? What if we could slow down this process? During research funded by the AthenaDAO community, Dr. Mario Cordero uncovered a surprising biological pathway, which may hold the key to new treatments. The pathway, known for its role in immune response, is called the cGAS-STING pathway.\n‍\n## The Role of the cGAS-STING Pathway in Ovarian Aging\nEmerging research shows that the cGAS-STING pathway might be a major cause of inflammation and tissue damage in aging ovaries. In both humans and animal models, higher levels of STING have been found in the ovaries, especially in a specific cell type called granulosa cells. These cells are crucial because they help eggs (oocytes) grow and mature, which is key to fertility. When this pathway is overactive in aging ovaries, it leads to increased production of certain inflammatory substances (such as IL-6 and Type I interferons). These substances cause inflammation and gradually reduce the ovaries' ability to function properly. When STING remains active for too long in ovarian cells, it can lead to several problems: the cells may age faster, their energy production can be disrupted, and their DNA can become damaged. \nAll of these issues can speed up the loss of eggs and simultaneously lower the quality of the remaining ones. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66ffef61b0f90976442afa54_66ffeeda9a8fe00a29339a8a_Screenshot%25202024-10-04%2520at%252015.34.00.png)\n_Figure 3: A mechanistic representation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Key mediators are highlighted and shows how STING interacts with other proteins to drive inflammation_[4]_._\n‍\n## Results from Dr. Cordero’s research so far\nThis research was designed to look at how the cGAS-STING pathway might be linked to aging in the ovaries and how it affects fertility. The researchers also studied how this process might be involved when chemotherapy damages the ovaries. The project was divided into three main parts, called work packages (WP).\n### WP1: Studying How the cGAS-STING Pathway Affects Aging in Ovaries\nIn the first part (WP1), the scientists looked at how the cGAS-STING pathway changes as women get older. The first experiments were designed to check whether or not cGAS-STING was involved at all with ovarian aging. If not, then it wouldn’t make sense to pursue further experiments. If yes, then full steam ahead!\nThey found that the STING protein is more active in older ovaries, which may contribute to the ovaries aging. This was seen in both human and mouse ovaries. They discovered that cells in the ovaries, especially in granulosa cells, are where this process happens most. Both mouse and human samples were tested because mice are often used as model organisms. However, if there was a big difference between the mouse and human data, then it would not be possible to continue using mice to study these effects, and another model organism would need to be chosen.\nSince the data showed that mice can be used as a tool to study these effects, Dr. Cordero’s lab continued with their plan, and used a STING knockout model to see what would happen to the ovarian reserves if the STING protein was no longer present. Knockout mice are used to study what happens in an organism when a particular gene is absent. \nDr. Cordero found that mice lacking the STING protein had more eggs and better fertility as they aged. The figure below shows mouse ovaries from ‘normal’ and ‘knockout’ mice, and the white arrows point to more follicles developing in the knockout mouse compared to the normal, wild-type mouse. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66ffeb785165643df10100db_AD_4nXd2AdnCkGN4xlHdKg55wtf6HXglnGK7K-WrMfszO_5SPyZyeD3j6fPjJeqCS33ySna213KQb-A5KxWJjHVuzdjsFApKe7Jn5ru_SmURvU6cWMeaSKzDUwPNDni50zM92StRiMJh66v-vkNz-Vr7PsUg7Hz5.png)\n_Figure 4: Ovaries from Dr. Cordero’s mouse experiments show that genetically normal “wild-type” female mice have very few developing follicles, compared to mice that have been genetically altered not to produce the STING protein anymore. The STING “knockout” mice have more follicles developing at different stages_\n‍\nFinally, the researchers also found that women with diminished ovarian reserve had higher STING activity in their ovarian cells, as shown by higher levels of STING protein levels in samples from a healthy female compared to samples from a female with DOR. \nTogether, the results from WP1 suggest that blocking the cGAS-STING pathway might help women keep their fertility longer as they get older. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66ffeb78d8f3fcf68dd47e9f_AD_4nXf4swM444g2nwoeoKGEZuUyjmsWlMxQ5rqEq18DjcqVrYSQ8v0DYM4JdWDwSRT3P04BvStK2ESRYG7emN84FceiaAMHMco8qhpc2T2R-2_oTIJav6QDIDltQMadJl6oCdMJcNdHZ7uHdwqukaMdhYyH8q8T.png)\n_Figure 5: Dr. Cordero’s western blot data, which measures levels of protein in a sample. Healthy female granulosa cells were compared to granulosa cells from females with Diminished Ovarian Reserves (DOR). The levels of STING protein were measured, and the levels were found to be higher in the DOR samples compared to the healthy samples. The beta-actin protein is used as an internal control to make sure protein levels are consistent between samples to allow for comparison._\n### WP2: Looking at Chemotherapy’s Effect on Ovaries\nIn the second part (WP2), the researchers wanted to see if the cGAS-STING pathway also plays a role in how chemotherapy damages the ovaries. Early findings showed that chemotherapy increases STING activity in patients. \nIn experiments with mice, they found that mice without the STING protein were protected from the harmful effects of chemotherapy on their ovaries. This means that blocking the cGAS-STING pathway could help protect women’s ovaries during chemotherapy, potentially saving their fertility while receiving life-saving treatment. \n### WP3: Creating Therapies to Block the cGAS-STING Pathway\nThe third part (WP3) was about developing new drugs to block the cGAS-STING pathway. The scientists tested several small molecules and found one, called \"A2,\" that works well at reducing the harmful effects of the cGAS-STING pathway, such as inflammation and cell death. This drug could be helpful in protecting or improving fertility in women as they age or undergo chemotherapy.\n‍\n## It's time to fundraise for the next milestones!\nTrue to the belief in equitable and accessible scientific research, AthenaDAO will be tokenizing the [Cordero IP-NFT](https://mint.molecule.to/ipnft/8) into [Intellectual Property Tokens (IPTs) ](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts)with the support of Molecule. These tokens enable the distribution of IP rights to holders to both raise funds for continued scientific research _and_ empower the community to govern the resulting IP.\nDue to the successful completion of the work packages in the first milestone of the project, Dr. Mario Cordero is looking to raise $75,000 USD to continue the work in milestone 2. With these funds, he is hoping to achieve two clear goals:\n  1. Continue the development of in vitro testing of these newly discovered inhibitors (A2) from WP3 \n  2. Test to see what happens when the cGAS-STING pathway is inhibited with Dr. Cordero’s newly developed compounds in animal models with reduced ovarian reserve\n\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66ffeb770d8d576b5995bfbe_AD_4nXdBcoOWfTwHjAwWulOkruNABal9GLC3qg0sqk2stTwPZ6Wmqi0VqU5VIfpneEjWqzHz7V_XVwdS0n662OHDcOwYdZw2JNCdHrewXOOpiQdBlvYAcjLr2e7r1dfNgB8LNa30icGb5P6ekIDyahHz5yZjZWqN.png)\n‍\n### Why choose the IPT model? \nBy giving community members the power to co-develop research projects via IPTs, AthenaDAO is harnessing the potential of decentralized science. As the project moves forward, important decisions—such as which delivery vehicles to test, the best disease indications for clinical trials, and how to raise additional funds—will be guided by the collective expertise of the community. With the power of IP tokenization, the wisdom of the crowd will play a critical role in shaping the future of fertility research.\nAthenaDAO will be sharing more details on the crowdsale soon - [subscribe to their newsletter](https://athenadao.substack.com/), [join the community on telegram](https://t.me/+N8nnR5RNFBcxNjI0), or [follow on X](https://x.com/athena_DAO_) so you can be the first to know. \n‍\n## Supporting research that matters\nAt its core, this research is about empowering women with new options for their reproductive health. By tackling ovarian aging at a deeper level, we’re moving closer to a future where the limits of biology can be redefined. We’ve been honored to support Dr. Cordero’s partnership with AthenaDAO, and hope that you’ll join us on this journey. \n‍\n## References:\n  1. Jirge, P.

As research continues to speed up and span across disciplines, the challenge of bringing new ideas and innovations from the academic sphere to the commercial realm becomes increasingly crucial. For instance, many of the top-selling therapeutics available today were originally developed in academia and had to navigate the difficult path of translation.\nThe process of transforming a therapeutic or technology from the research and development stage into a market-ready product or service is intricate and laden with obstacles. Presently, it calls for the cooperation and coordination of a multitude of organizations, along with funding, expertise, collaboration, and various other resources and support. BioDAOs streamline the process by consolidating all pertinent stakeholders into a single, internet-based virtual organization. This vertical integration enables a seamless end-to-end approach, fostering increased efficiency, collaboration, and resource-sharing throughout the entire research and development journey.\nIn this brief piece, we delve into the challenges and opportunities associated with translating research from academic institutions and investigate how organizations like BioDAOs are contributing to the support and facilitation of this vital process.\n## The Primitives of Biomedical Discovery and Development\nIt's noteworthy that the majority of approved medicines, around 60%, have their roots in academia, [with the remaining 40% stemming from pharmaceutical research and discovery](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126). Early-stage therapeutic research generally involves target-based or phenotypic screening using cell lines (in vitro) and model organisms (in vivo), [depending on the disease model being studied](https://www.plengegen.com/wp-content/uploads/Swinney_ClinPharmTher_2013_phenotypic-screens.pdf). This work is often [grant-funded and carried out in academic labs](https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2377-9-S1-S2) until patents or other intellectual property (IP) are filed by the university's technology transfer office (TTO).\nThe university then licenses the IP to an existing pharmaceutical company or a biotech startup, which takes on Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies. These studies involve more in vivo testing in increasingly larger animals to evaluate safety and efficacy. This phase is typically executed by private biotech labs and/or contract research organizations, funded by venture capital and/or pharma balance sheets. Clinical development kicks off when the company files an [IND with the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs/fdas-drug-review-process-ensuring-drugs-are-safe-and-effective), progressing through Phase I for safety, Phase II for early signs of efficacy, and Phase III for determining full approval.\nOnce an experimental medicine has undergone all clinical development phases, the company files a new drug application ([NDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/new-drug-application-nda) - or [MAA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/marketing-authorisation/obtaining-eu-marketing-authorisation-step-step)), which can be approved or denied by the FDA (or EMA). If approved, the company can then market and distribute the therapeutic. This process entails a blend of patient- and physician-targeted marketing to ensure the maximum number of eligible patients receive the treatment.\nThroughout this progression, the therapeutic IP is often transferred among multiple organizations, including academia, biotech, and pharma. Funding typically comes from a [mix of government agencies, venture capitalists (VCs), and pharmaceutical companies](https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2377-9-S1-S2). The goal of a BioDAO is to consolidate all funding and development functions for a specific therapeutic area within a single organization, streamlining the entire process.\n## What is a BioDAO?\nA [BioDAO](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-emergence-of-biotech-daos) refers to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that specializes in harnessing the collective efforts of a diverse group of stakeholders to expedite the development and distribution of biotechnology products and services, spanning from early concept to market. BioDAOs fund and incubate projects during the initial stages of translational research, often through IP-NFTs, [even before a company is established](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm-91312d8d92e6). While venture studios and corporate venture arms share similarities, BioDAOs stand out as community-owned and operated entities.\nContrasting with venture studios and corporate venture arms, where investment is the primary activity and profits are distributed to shareholders or partners, investment in BioDAOs is a secondary endeavor within the community, akin to venture investments by a university endowment supporting the university's operations. Returns from BioDAO investments are channeled into funding further research and operations, mirroring how a university endowment's investments contribute to additional research, facility improvements, and the university's functioning. However, BioDAOs differ from universities in their ability to vertically integrate the scientific discovery and commercial development of biotechnology products and services for a specific indication or therapeutic area, unifying all relevant stakeholders within a single, internet-based virtual organization.\nDuring a project's early stages, BioDAOs engage in activities such as inventing novel IP, funding and developing research from its members and consolidating biomedical datasets among their members. As projects advance and gain value within the community, BioDAOs allocate more resources toward company formation, business development, scaling, regulatory filing, and distribution of biotechnology products. By fostering a community of stakeholders with aligned incentives and diverse backgrounds, BioDAOs facilitate the translation of technologies. In this regard, BioDAOs can be viewed as collaborative research translation engines and a novel form of biotech organization that develops IP through an online-native approach.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6412f67c0ab8d6e7a6a14564_Z9JhN1jW7h-cnr6SWrQ8NzpTVvAXTZ5ykNj0J_pcJo6GSIbVeKXuCYznMmyUYblC5ho57fvraYvUVTRjeuC6gI603AaXH9kZRsoAmhTVi211zqGpeo4Tni_XO2ur_nLlu88-1V7mwXdsJV3fCN2jLA.png)\n## How do BioDAOs differ from investment DAOs?\n[Investment DAOs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-investment-daos-and-how-do-they-work), such as [MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/), [FlamingoDAO](https://flamingodao.xyz/), [The LAO](https://www.thelao.io/) and [BeakerDAO](https://beakerdao.xyz/), primarily focus on pooling capital to generate profits that are distributed to their stakeholders. These organizations represent a collective of investors aiming to achieve the highest possible risk-adjusted financial returns. For instance, a member of The LAO may receive a distribution of profits resulting from the capital deployed by The LAO into a project.\nOn the other hand, BioDAOs concentrate on developing novel IP and funding research and development of its members. The capital they deploy aims to generate value for their members and returns that can be reinvested in further R&D, rather than yielding profits for stakeholders or distributing them. Similar to how a university member benefits from enhanced research facilities, program funding, and administrative support provided by the university endowment without receiving direct proceeds, a BioDAO member benefits from the organization's successful R&D efforts.\nBioDAOs are designed to facilitate and support vertically integrated R&D by granting members access to necessary resources and expertise for the successful development and commercialization of new biotechnology products and services. The community isn't primarily composed of investors; instead, it consists of researchers, entrepreneurs, companies, patients, and other stakeholder groups, most of whom contribute their time and effort rather than capital. The activities of a BioDAO encompass funding R&D investments and other functions such as community education, company formation, project incubation, access to expertise and knowledge, networking opportunities, member data aggregation, and assistance with regulatory compliance and various challenges. By offering these resources and support, BioDAOs aid their members in overcoming the numerous obstacles involved in transitioning technology from the research and development stage to a commercially viable product or service.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6412f67ca909036e90a4b203_qbd9eswOXlLQoiVvgEkb1qc9bWznFTQAa06KwDQwrejN5SkFszXypWRMaEwAZhbuWHdnWV_qZZTnuT699V7mRWglcF8_80v4NuVOzvNAVOEzVxFdYl_gqVLsJ6BTwnnAW2Q0liYI8ZIJCN4jnMGtPA.png)\n## The mission of BioDAOs is to incubate and translate research\nThe mission and vision of BioDAOs are patient- and-impact-centric compared to VC funding. While VC funding emphasizes maximizing return on investment for partners or shareholders, BioDAOs concentrate on supporting and facilitating the development of effective biotechnology products and services for humanity. Structured around a sustainability loop, BioDAOs create an endowment to fund research indefinitely. Below is an example of how VitaDAO has structured its sustainability loop.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6412f67d3ef414e8870efc7f_kAtZJMc8lpkI7QOtmiYxhVmmEXVUiqFpp5ry2i2EUOiiuioXb6PWJv64xDNKa3GPU3_Y4Y_6kv9EN5xTdOgEMfkYdJ881IRVOCAPiZ68Gi8dyDt9HjYjaYKxhvclMI4fdzvbv0438yergolL8Omiog.png)\nBioDAOs generally offer resources and support to their members, helping them develop and commercialize new biotechnology products and services. This assistance can include funding for research and development, access to expertise and knowledge, and networking opportunities within the BioDAO community. In contrast to VC firms, which exclusively focus on investing in companies to generate financial returns for their investors, BioDAOs are solely dedicated to funding R&D that benefits their communities within their respective subject areas.\nAs a result, the mission and vision of BioDAOs align more closely with the needs and objectives of researchers and patients.\n## Examples of BioDAOs and Their Activities\n[VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), among the first BioDAOs, exemplifies how a BioDAO's function fundamentally differs from an investment DAO. VitaDAO comprises working groups of experts in various fields (refer to the figure above). Anyone can join VitaDAO by contributing either funding or time (work). In return, they receive governance tokens in the organization, granting them voting rights on proposals, such as which research projects to fund or how to support a project. The fact that many VitaDAO members join by contributing time and receive tokens, rather than providing funding, significantly differentiates it from an investment DAO. VitaDAO features many more operational roles than funding roles. Many of the largest token holders are those who actively participate in research project sourcing, evaluation, peer review, and operational activities for the DAO. Another major differentiator from an investment DAO lies in the allocation of proceeds from funding research that generates and monetizes IP. In VitaDAO, these proceeds return to the VitaDAO treasury to finance further projects. In an investment DAO, a portion of the proceeds directly goes to its members, but in VitaDAO, no portion is directly distributed to VITA holders. Instead, similar to a university researcher who may benefit from better facilities and increased research funding due to successful investments made by the university endowment, a VitaDAO member may gain advantages from the organization's funding activities.\nVitaDAO community members with relevant experience collaborate with researchers on their projects, reviewing data and offering feedback on experimental direction. For instance, VitaDAO's deal flow and legal working groups negotiate deal terms with universities on behalf of the researcher and the DAO. The DAO efficiently leverages its extensive network of highly effective individuals using token incentivization. As research progresses, DAO community members assist with the creation of spin-outs to advance research to the next stage.\nThis interdisciplinary, cross working group approach to incubating and advancing research sets BioDAOs apart. In some cases, the DAO is so proficient in this task that negotiating research agreements and initiating projects takes [weeks](https://from.ncl.ac.uk/funding-science-through-blockchain-technology-and-cryptocurrencies), compared to the industry standard of [months](https://from.ncl.ac.uk/funding-science-through-blockchain-technology-and-cryptocurrencies). Some BioDAO activities, such as [decentralized tech transfer (DTT)](https://vitadao.medium.com/decentralized-technology-transfer-dtt-1f12a90aa641), capitalize on the community and academic consultants as a collective intelligence to design experiments, create research projects, and generate IP within the DAO itself.\n## Decentralize or not? That is the question.\nBiopharma R&D is gravitating toward increased decentralization, outsourcing much high-risk work to specialist contract organizations while keeping IP and data storage centralized internally. BioDAOs, however, offer an alternative by federating IP and data on Ethereum instead of keeping them siloed. This creates a more efficient superstructure and a new paradigm for biopharma R&D, boasting benefits like standardized data generation and decentralized analysis and interpretation.\nData structure and quality can vary significantly when performed by disparate entities, giving federated data acquisition an advantage over siloed, unconnected systems. Federated data is more likely to generate valuable insights through superior statistical power because it is compared against similar data in an open, connected system. For instance, RNA sequencing is highly sensitive to [batch effects](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/2/3/lqaa078/5909519), and using a single high-quality RNAseq provider to federate data is more likely to result in the highest statistical power than multiple providers who don't share data and correct each dataset for data science purposes.\nData federation has compelling benefits, especially in areas like clinical trial recruitment. If clinical trial repositories or patient data are not connected via data federation, both the biopharma company and the patient or physician may miss eligible patients for clinical trials. Just as efficient financial markets require maximum liquidity on both supply and demand sides, data also needs to be highly liquid to create the most value for patients and biopharma companies.\nHowever, centralization has its advantages in specific scenarios. For example, therapeutics manufacturing can benefit from centralization through economies of scale, resulting in the best drug prices for patients. Moreover, centralized data capture and/or storage can lead to dataset standardization. When federated, this standardized data—originally captured and stored centrally—can be even more advantageous to biopharma R&D, bringing top scientific and medical minds to the data for high-value decision-making. Existing biopharma companies often capture these centralization benefits, but there are numerous advantages of decentralization that are not fully exploited.\nAlthough biopharma is moving toward more significant decentralization, it's only tapping into a fraction of the potential benefits. Most pharmaceutical companies have venture investment arms, but the quality and quantity of deal flow are constrained by the limited size of corporate venture teams. By expanding the team size and opening it up to a community, it's likely to increase connections, deal flow quality and quantity, and the expertise leveraged for decision-making. Decentralized entities also have competitive advantages, such as greater access to capital and patients. Decentralization offers a genuine means to regain [public trust lost in recent years](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/life-sciences/trust-in-biopharmaceutical-companies-covid.html). This can be achieved by providing incentives and governance rights to patients participating in clinical research, shifting biopharma's focus from profits to patient value. Compensating patients with ownership and governance rights in the medicines they often risk their lives for can significantly increase their willingness to participate in research and expedite the clinical research process. For example, [clinical trial recruitment often limits the progression of clinical-stage therapeutics](https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/28/recruitment-retention-silent-crises-clinical-trials/), and the lack of a sense of ownership and governance among participating patients may be partially responsible. This shift from profit to patient value could boost biopharma's public trust and efficiency. In this respect, BioDAOs offer a solution that prioritizes patients over shareholders as the primary stakeholders.\n## Conclusion and future outlook for BioDAOs\nBioDAOs represent a distinctive type of DAO that focuses on creating a comprehensive research translation ecosystem and novel IP creation engines. This approach enables BioDAOs to connect scientific innovation with real-world application, making them valuable players in the fast-paced biotechnology sector.\nIn the future, one might imagine that BioDAOs natively integrate AI and LLM capabilities, built and steered by their members to outright produce novel IP and therapeutics themselves and coordinate their development, thus decoupling from the current university and industry funding landscape. We believe that the pace and speed at which this may happen could surprise industry and provide an extremely valuable addition to the research landscape, given the agility, speed and open source nature that is required to make AI drug development capabilities and model development successful.\nUnlike investment DAOs, BioDAOs generate returns to finance R&D rather than distribute profits to stakeholders. Nevertheless, similar to how university researchers and students benefit from improved research facilities and program funding provided by university endowments, BioDAO members may also reap the rewards of the BioDAOs' successes.\nThe existence of BioDAOs is grounded in the idea that patients and researchers are disenfranchised from the core stages of therapeutic development. Yet, they they have the strongest incentive and motivation for finding cures. Community-governed research translation organizations offer a solution. The motivations for prestige among academics and profits among venture capitalists are potent, but the desire for patients to alleviate their suffering is even more powerful. This underutilized driving force from patients could accelerate drug discovery, and BioDAOs aim to harness that potential.\nIn the future, BioDAOs are poised to play a vital role in advancing biotechnology, biotech-centric AI and bringing novel innovations to market. As DAO technology continues to evolve, BioDAOs are expected to gain wider adoption. The enormous potential of BioDAOs to drive progress and foster collaboration in biotechnology is disruptive and worth monitoring in the years to come.  \n‍  \nTo learn more about BioDAOs, check out [bio.xyz](https://bio.xyz) and the [BioDAO Bible](https://docs.molecule.to/bio.xyz/biodao-bible/introduction).\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/biodaos-are-community-owned-research-translation-engines-not-investment-daos)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/biodaos-are-community-owned-research-translation-engines-not-investment-daos)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/biodaos-are-community-owned-research-translation-engines-not-investment-daos)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

The coalescence of engineering and biology sees scientists utilize gene editing technologies to redesign and reprogram living cells to exhibit novel functions, offering up a host of solutions that would otherwise not be possible. With over 100 scientific articles and 5 patents, [Dr Rodrigo Ledsma Amaro](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.ledesma-amaro) is an established leader in the field of synthetic biology, with a particular focus on metabolic engineering and microbial biotechnology. \n> _‘I saw the potential of microorganisms and their versatility to be engineered to produce, in a sustainable manner, everything we need and we currently make from petrochemicals (e.g. food ingredients) or damaging agricultural practices (e.g. palm oil).  \n>  -Dr Rodrigo Ledesma Amaro_\nIt is this work that led Rodrigo to [ValleyDAO](https://www.valleydao.bio/), a recent graduate of the [bio.xyz](https://www.bio.xyz/) program. They share a common mission; to utilize synthetic biology to create innovative approaches to environmental and societal challenges. ValleyDAO has committed £228 000 to Rodrigo’s lab at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in exchange for a portion of the intellectual property produced, by minting their first IP-NFT. The funds will go towards Rodrigo’s work in [optimizing oil extraction from oleaginous yeast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0LvHhAnoA) The project embodies ValleyDAO’s vision of supporting transformative scientific advancements that promise a sustainable and resilient future.\n> _\"This model is more than just about funding. It allows us to publicly present our ideas, and if they resonate with the community, secure potential funding. In essence, ValleyDAO is democratizing the way scientific research is perceived, valued, and supported.\"  \n>  - Dr Rodrigo Ledesma Amaro_\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/64d0ec41361c7b605b81796b_Rodrigo.jpg)\nDr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro\n### Improved Lipid Production in Yeasts\nLipids, colloquially known as fats or oils, are used in food production, as well as the cosmetics and fuel industry. At present, we use animal- and vegetable-originated lipids in these industries - unfortunately the sourcing of these lipids is done through unsustainable practices such as palm oil harvesting. Microbes provide a favorable alternative but come at a much higher price tag. \n_Yarrowia lipolytica_ is a species of oleaginous yeast which is known for its naturally high lipid accumulation, and is the subject of Rodrigo’s work. By bioengineering these oleaginous yeasts, scientists can further increase their oil yield, providing a sustainable source of fatty acids which are essential to the food industry. As it stands, Rodrigo and his team of 30 scientists at Imperial College London have pioneered a synbio approach that causes these oils to be secreted out of the yeast cells and into the culture broth, bypassing the extraction step, which is the cause behind the high costs of microbial oil production. While this Proof-of-Concept research has established a viable pathway to improving lipid harvesting, the process itself needs improvement. This is where the funds from ValleyDAO will be essential! The team will continue their research surrounding the process, as well as investigate the possibility of a continuous fermentation process. Continual fermentation and oil collection will mean that the large vats of yeast will not need to be processed additionally in order to extract oils, creating a more energy and carbon-efficient technique. If successful, lipid harvesting costs in _Yarrowia lipolytica_ will be reduced by up-to 70%.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/64c399bb89c8fd4d0e0198bd_dkTzrBSIBfuQw5kWYwzgfOd1bBnPoe9oK8MRQ0jLR5U0PF5r7yNo1pS2trgY3vP0bfjA9h01tiTkokIJRyjMUEcYKVjjv8s5PVmmgLtqK4QIdVrbIg6g3OUqrdEGNgMDccu7DaPSMDgzpxs9zDZKyDk.png)\nA conceptual representation, generated by MidJourney, of lipid particles being secreted through a cell membrane\n### Commercial Use of Microbial Oils\nEdible oil practices are responsible for environmental degradation through destructive farming processes as well as energy-intensive methodology. With a growing population, the need for edible oils is only increasing, signifying that Rodrigo’s research is not only ethical but also well-placed in a growing industry. In creating methods to increase oil production and extraction in yeast, foundations are being laid for further research, with the potential to create sustainable biofuels which would help mitigate the ravaging effects of global warming and climate change.\n### Collaboration Opportunities\nCurrently, numerous companies are working on producing food oils and fats through microbial means in a cost-efficient manner, but face issues of scalability in their manufacturing processes. As industrial biotechnology companies scale up their production, they often encounter challenges in maintaining the efficiency and viability of microorganisms used, as well as recovering the products they produce. “Throughout this project's lifetime, we want to invite these companies to the table to collaborate with us on this project,” says Albert Anis, core lead at ValleyDAO. \n### Why IP-NFT?\nIP-NFT-based financing ensures that any resulting Intellectual Property (IP) from a research project is governed by the ValleyDAO community, using the DAO’s native governance token, GROW.\nBy doing so, ValleyDAO is not only directly involved in sourcing, reviewing, and voting on which projects should be funded but also in the licensing and governance of the resulting IP. This provides a more democratic IP-management strategy, fostering the direct participation of synthetic biology enthusiasts in the funding and translation of a research project. The impact of this novel approach extends beyond the financial realm. As Rodrigo notes, \"ValleyDAO's ability to bridge the gap between science and the broader community fosters a genuine interest in, and support for, future discoveries.\"\nIP-NFTs provide several downstream benefits for the resulting IP. First, given the record of IP ownership is on a public ledger, IP record of ownership is open, increasing the discoverability of IP. Second, given the rights of IP are held within smart contracts, researchers globally can collaborate without the need to trust one another, with rights enforcement via code. In addition, IP-NFTs enable greater transactability, with programmable sublicenses and without the need for traditional legal agreements, with terms such as royalty and milestone payments being automatable. \nThe [IP-NFT](https://etherscan.io/nft/0xcaD88677CA87a7815728C72D74B4ff4982d54Fc1/3) is named SavedApe: Microbial Lipid Production with Synthetic Biology and the image represents a playful allegory of humans and orangutans - affected by deforestation due to palm oil production - collaborating to develop sustainable solutions in a lab environment, signifying the commitment to replace harmful practices with sustainable bioengineered alternatives.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/64c399bc1e2d449f68a61564_L5thLUTnvrfiUFxCZSRhVEyHl3XhJS1NRzuGC7lXaHcy6ADO8FlWlMGJ_fMfZ_5kHUp07t7w36HfmnF88UEhiuSKFTPxdWd6kb6pkBjktsXc6Hr7Uk-xm-3AKErWyRoxjM5fhjGp0Va028DjMg_cJEc.png)\n### A Call to Fellow SynBio Scientists\nValleyDAO has started its journey in funding world-changing science with a bang and has no intention of slowing down.

These primitives gave developers a solid foundation to remix and connect, triggering a wave of unstoppable innovation.\nDeSci is now standing at a similar inflection point.\n### From hypothesis to onchain IP\nThe first BioAgents launching on Bio Protocol will integrate directly with ResearchHub, enabling a new kind of autonomous research workflow.\nHere’s what that means in practice:\n  * BioAgents post new hypotheses directly to ResearchHub.  \n  \n\n  * Each hypothesis carries $RSC bounties, attracting review and input from a global network of scientists.  \n  \n\n  * Once refined and validated, the hypothesis is minted as IP tokens on Molecule; turning it into an ownable, fundable onchain research asset.\n\n\n### The DeSci flywheel in motion\nThis integration lays the groundwork for the most powerful coordination loop in decentralized science.\n**Full-cycle view:**\n  1. **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** stores and links verified scientific knowledge.  \n  \n\n  2. **BioAgents generate hypotheses** by tapping into the DKG.  \n  \n\n  3. **Peer review on ResearchHub** refines and validates the ideas.  \n  \n\n  4. **IPT minting on Molecule** transforms validated ideas into fundable research assets.  \n  \n\n  5. **Transparent funding, execution, and proof** : Experiments run, results are verified, and data flows back into the DKG.  \n  \n\n\n\nThis results in a self-reinforcing, permissionless research engine improving with every cycle, raising the quality of science, accelerating discovery, and bringing major elements of the scientific process onchain.\n### Why this matters\nJust like DeFi primitives unlocked permissionless finance, DeSci primitives are unlocking permissionless science.\nHypotheses can surface daily, validation happens in the open, IP is tradable from day one, and the pursuit of truth becomes faster and more inclusive than ever before.\nThe debut of BioAgents marks the first turn of the hypothesis-to-IP flywheel. As these integrations deepen, the DeSci community will be able to follow an idea from its first spark to validated proof and with every step happening onchain.\nExplore [Bio Protocol](https://www.bio.xyz/), [ResearchHub](https://www.researchhub.com/), and [Molecule](http://molecule.xyz/) to see how these pieces fit together to power the next era of scientific breakthroughs.\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/building-the-hypothesis-to-ip-flywheel-bioagents-researchhub-molecule)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/building-the-hypothesis-to-ip-flywheel-bioagents-researchhub-molecule)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/building-the-hypothesis-to-ip-flywheel-bioagents-researchhub-molecule)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

    "url": "https://www.molecule.to/blog/decentralized-science-inspired-by-meta-and-open-science-principles",
    "markdown": "![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/656de9a01c1f57da229192e0_imresizer-1701702031366.png)\n## Decoding Decentralized Science\nTo fully conceptualize Molecule’s mission and vision, one needs to understand the arena in which we operate. Decentralized Science (DeSci) is a new approach to science that applies principles from Meta- and Open-Science and is a powerful new non-crypto application of blockchain technology. More than just a blend of Meta-Science and Open-Science, DeSci represents their next evolution. It uses web3 technology to establish a secure, lasting record of scientific contributions that enables fair credit allocation, simplifies transactions, allows worldwide resource sharing, and overcomes economic barriers. We believe, emphatically, that it is the answer to many of the problems that are plaguing the academic community today. \n‍\n## Open-Science as the forefather\nThroughout recent history, scientific productivity has been [decreasing steadily](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176520304067#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20we%20find,et%20al.%2C%202020), largely due to information being increasingly sequestered in institutional silos. Recognizing these issues, researchers began to speak out, asking for more transparent communication between academics. As a result, the transformative movement of Open-Science (OpSci) was born, aiming to foster transparency, collaboration, and democracy within the scientific process. It is perhaps the most well-known and mature effort to update the scientific system and community over the past decades. \nOpSci encourages interaction between various stakeholders, including researchers, funders, publishers, and policymakers. It birthed the notable ‘citizen science’ movement; allowing normal people who care about scientific progress to contribute to research, capitalizing on the power of numbers to bolster data collection. This shift underscores the principle that science should be accessible regardless of socioeconomic status. However, OpSci encounters challenges such as a lack of incentivization for active participation, complications in data and code sharing, concerns about plagiarism of preprints, obstacles in resource accessibility, and instances of misrepresentation in media. Despite its noble objectives, these issues represent hurdles that OpSci still needs to overcome in order to fully revolutionize scientific practices. \n‍\n## Meta-Science as a critical analysis\nMeta-Science, the exploration of science itself, analyzes the core processes of collaboration, experimentation, observation, and knowledge dissemination. While OpSci focuses on breaking down walls within science, Meta-Science aims to analyze the entire scientific ecosystem. By taking a holistic view, Meta-Science identifies the causes behind issues such as the reproducibility crisis and bias, to ultimately enhance research quality. Meta-Science also aims to look at which social processes can spark a move towards better science - while most researchers can fully conceptualize the issues that plague traditional science, there seems to be little impetus at an institutional level to improve various processes. This study of science itself gives a bird's eye view over the academic landscape, identifying classic blockers and bottlenecks, however, the movement tends to be more observational than actionable. Integrating and implementing solutions remains crucial. \n‍\n## Decentralized Science as applied Meta-Science and Open-Science, and more…\nDeSci has arisen as Meta-Science and Open-Science’s natural heir; conserving their core attributes but improving upon their issues. It promises to break down barriers, offering a more inclusive and equitable platform for scientific discovery and collaboration. It does so by taking advantage of the technology available - without this, DeSci would never have been able to blossom as it has. It has matured into a fully-fledged unique cause with devoted contributors, drawing in an amazing array of expertise, all aligned with the common goal of improving science and ultimately, the world.\n‍\n## The movement has anchored itself to a couple of core values:\n_These values are not an exhaustive list, but a sample to aid in understanding the movement. We’ve included a comprehensive reading list at the end of this article for further research._\n### Fair incentives\nDeSci promotes open collaboration between scientists across the world, while simultaneously creating an incentive structure through token rewards and governance. This reward system ensures motivation, which was a prevalent issue within the OpSci movement. Central to the movement is the belief that researchers should be valued for their contributions - after all, they are the champions who work relentlessly to improve and understand the world around us.\n### Transparency\nBy leveraging blockchain, DeSci also ensures traceability, fair crediting, and secure transactions. An immutable record of contributions protects researchers’ work while fostering an ethos of transparency. Valuable educational resources should not be held in ivory towers and suffocated behind paywalls. Science is for the people and thus should be accessible to the people. \n### Alternative funding models\nDeSci offers innovative funding models. While Meta-Science could identify bottlenecks such as inefficient grant systems, feasible solutions were hard to come across. This is because Meta-Science is still working within the realms of traditional science. DeSci has subtle architectural differences; it creates new models that are _complementary_ to traditional structures but not bound by them. An example of this are [biotechnology Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](https://www.molecule.xyz/blog/biodaos-are-community-owned-research-translation-engines-not-investment-daos), which are collectives of people committed to funding and pursuing innovative academic research. Well-known examples include [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), [AthenaDAO](https://www.athenadao.co/), [HairDAO](https://www.hairdao.xyz/), and [ValleyDAO](https://www.valleydao.bio/). \n### Global connections\nDemocratizing access to tools enhances efficiency and inclusivity, enabling an accelerated pace of discoveries. These advancements enable ‘networked science’, a phrase that refers to the ability of one researcher to source knowledge immediately from another researcher across the world. The benefit of having the world’s knowledge at your fingertips means the discovery process can be exponentially streamlined.\n### Modernising workflows\nAs the world changes and technological developments accrue, we’d be foolish to not leap upon the advantages technology can provide. Apps, software, and protocols that exist to automate processes are welcomed, allowing humans to spend more time working on the hard things. Examples vary from funding technologies, lab work tracking, and DAO governance structures. These technologies are built to be ‘trustless’ meaning that they are created to exclude bias or tampering. Human error and politics are largely eliminated with transparent, immutable records. \n### Revolutionary spirit\nCore to the movement is a revolutionary spirit; we sit at the precipice of something important that has the potential to mitigate human suffering, and that will take passion and action to manifest. As a community we are embracing the creation of a new paradigm. \n‍\n## Molecule’s role in DeSci\nIn a nutshell, Molecule is a protocol, marketplace and service provider to the DeSci community. We exist to support, empower, guide, and provide. As a team, we host a yearly DeSci conference ([DeSci.Berlin](https://www.desci.berlin/)) and run a biotechnology DAO accelerator named [bio.xyz](https://www.bio.xyz/). However, we are most well-known for our products; [Intellectual Property Non-Fungible Tokens (IP-NFTs)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/introducing-ip-nft-v2) and [Intellectual Property Tokens (IPTs)](https://www.molecule.xyz/blog/molecule-launches-intellectual-property-tokens-ipts). \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/656de9d1753e259da9d1f2b8_M3arGi_sATsEWqtHt32h3flDM8RaCU7rhpNwhkVvpmDOCkfKk5fSZghhqZgRTd9Bwc_xdDac8WGP0maUhepqsTWr8zVqq24OeWwUW7w7QaduLdR3yCit48TzJqGMUmWOtE__EKMMmKK76_i9LL1EGwo.png)\n### The IP-NFT\nIntellectual Property Non-Fungible Tokens (IP-NFTs) are onchain intellectual property (IP) contracts. IP-NFTs register IP rights onchain. By unifying data and property rights into programmable, transactable, blockchain tokens in the internet of money, IP-NFTs represent an evolutionary step in the development and management of scientific research IP. To date, IP-NFTs have been used to register IP of more than $2M in scientific research including at many world-renowned universities. \n### IPTs\nIP tokens (IPTs) are onchain memberships in IP-NFTs. When IP-NFT holders mint IPTs, they create tokenized IP commons managed by their members, accelerating the progress of science through incentives to coordinate. IPTs enable IP governance, not ownership along with milestone-based fundraising for scientific research. By minting IPTs, IP-NFT holders can incentivize contributors to IP development and enable their IP to be priced by free markets.\n‍\n## DeSci in action: Longevity, Dr. Korolchuk & VITA-FAST\n[Dr. Viktor Korolchuk](https://twitter.com/VIKorolchuk) knew very little about web3 when he first came across VitaDAO. In dire need of funding though, as most academics are, he decided to take a chance and proposed his project; identifying novel autophagy activators that could potentially slow cellular decline and work to treat Alzheimer’s disease. [Within six weeks](https://from.ncl.ac.uk/funding-science-through-blockchain-technology-and-cryptocurrencies) Dr. Korolchuk’s project was vetted and approved, granting him $285,000 to perform his research. \n[The Korolchuk IP-NFT](https://discover.molecule.to/projects/cl4o42oq8070309jo2wkopvqt) went on to become the first project tokenized in an IPT sale, representing a massive step forward in the decentralization of science. The sale was over 1700% oversubscribed, once again showing a clear community appetite for this sort of thing. The IPTs, known as [VITA-FAST](https://mint.molecule.to/ipnft/2), were distributed to all those who contributed to the sale, along with Dr. Korolchuk, the [University of Newcastle](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/), and deal-flow contributors, demonstrating the democratization of science in real time. Now, VITA-FAST token holders are able to vote upon project developments, such as which assays to perform, which labs to engage with, and how IP licensing may occur. \nDr. Korolchuk and the team have recently completed a tertiary screen with compounds that have been selected for their ability to induce autophagy in the two previous screens. After finding several very promising compound families, the team is now investigating which chemical series should be explored further in search of patentable and optimized lead compounds.\n‍\n## Decentralized science depends on community, and we’d love to have you. \nBy addressing OpSci and Meta-Sciences's shortcomings, DeSci presents a refined, democratic, and secure framework for scientific exploration, making research more accessible and incentivized. Let's build and advance decentralized science together, leveraging the power of community to create a better world for you and your loved ones. \n‍\n## Curious and want to know more?

Founded in early 2018, Sora Ventures is Asia’s leading venture capital firm dedicated to digital asset and blockchain investments. The firm adopts an entirely new venture model designed to scale blockchain community and help transition blockchain projects into the business world. This strategic investment aims to pioneer the integration of DeSci across the continent. The goal is to transcend physical borders and foster a culture of objective science and intellectual property sharing, leveraging the decentralized nature of DeSci.\n## Why Globalisation Matters to Molecule\nMolecule is a proud and active supporter of the DeSci movement. Engaging in partnerships such as these is critical in ensuring the global uptake of the movement. A core principle remains the inclusion of people from around the world, opening up pockets of exceptionally valuable and previously localized knowledge.\n## An Open Invitation to Asia’s Scientists \nMolecule extends a warm invitation to scientists across Asia to join this transformative journey. This initiative is not just about funding; it's a call to action for scientists to be part of a movement that redefines how scientific research is conducted and shared in an open-source manner powered by the permissionless nature of tokenisation.\n## Empowering Innovation: Molecule's $50,000 Award\nTo catalyze innovation in the field of biomedical research, Molecule is offering a $50,000 award to a deserving scientific team or individual. By offering this award exclusively to researchers based in Asia, Molecule hopes to set off a chain reaction culminating in a revolutionized scientific landscape. If you are interested in receiving application details once they have been released, please add your name and email address to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXZZwDyg-FT_rc451zmWDy24mpiDO3ThRWAFNHagInkTc3aQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). \n## Why This Time is Different: The DeSci Paradigm\nDeSci diverges fundamentally from its predecessor, Decentralized Finance (DeFi). While DeFi often replicated the exclusive and extractive nature of traditional finance, DeSci heralds a new dawn of inclusivity and democratization in scientific research. Today, pharmaceutical companies grapple with declining returns on innovation, facing stiff competition in discovering new medicines. DeSci emerges as a beacon of hope, empowering those historically marginalized in science - the scientists and patients.\n## Tokenized Science: The Unstoppable Force\nThe rise of NFTs has revolutionized the art world by empowering artists with a platform for recognition and fair compensation.

He has, in his own words, been afforded the luck and privilege of being able to jump between industries over the years, following what interested him. After receiving his PhD in neuroscience from Oxford and a brief lecturership at Newcastle, he entered the commercial world, working with the Boston Consulting Group, then into healthcare investment at Sanford Bernstein, and then back and forth between biotech drug discovery, investment, and R&D consulting. This journey has given him a very broad view of the industry; all the way from the academic lab to the shelves of your local pharmacy. \nIt was this expertise that led him to write the seminal paper, “[Diagnosing the Decline in Pharmaceutical R&D Efficiency](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3681?error=cookies_not_supported&code=21dc4b8e-f754-448f-8ed6-8dce1e68fa76)” in 2012. The paper was the result of Jack’s puzzling over a pervasive contrast occurring in the biopharma industry. At the time, much of the messaging surrounding drug discovery was exceptionally positive and hopeful. The advent of technologies such as genomics, computational chemistry, genetically modified animals, and high-throughput screening were said to have delivered an injection of efficiency into drug discovery. The scientific rhetoric was that things were _good._ However, Jack saw the opposite productivity trend in terms of the things that really mattered; fewer and fewer new drugs per unit of scientists’ time, or dollar of public or private sector R&D investment. So why was the scientific rhetoric so different from the economic reality? \nIt was in the act of examining why huge falls in R&D output efficiency happened in the face of huge gains in R&D input efficiency, that the term ‘Eroom’s Law’ was born. Eroom’s Law is Moore’s Law (the exponential increase in computer power over time) spelled backward; a play on the exponential decrease in pharmaceutical R&D output efficiency in the face of exponential gains in input efficiency. Inflation-adjusted R&D expenses per new drug launched **roughly doubled** every nine years from 1950 to 2010 while, for example, DNA sequencing had become ten billion times cheaper, and X-ray crystallography has become ten thousand times cheaper.\n![How Drugs Got So Expensive - Interview with Jack Scannell | Refoundable](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/659fda6bb4b3c45400bbdff0_res-int-scannell-1.png)\nImage credit: Graph first displayed in Jack's 2012 paper '_Diagnosing the Decline in Pharmaceutical R &D Efficiency_'\n## Jack's Hypotheses and Future Outlook\nIt was clear that something was definitely wrong, but what? Certain things like management and organizational structure had not changed drastically enough over the past 60 years to create such a situation, so there had to be some other explanation for the dramatic change.\nJack had a number of hypotheses, which he lumps into two main groups: \n(1) Running out of critical resources\nRoughly 90% of all prescription drugs prescribed in the US are generics. Think about the last time someone you know got antibiotics at the pharmacy, or medication for stomach ulcers, hypertension, or depression. Did they get a generic, or did they get a branded drug? Chances are it was a generic; a drug that was discovered decades ago and which is now available at low cost. When there are cheap generic alternatives that work just fine, it is very hard for expensive new drugs to compete. This has progressively pushed drug R&D into the areas where, over the last 100 years, the drug industry has had the least success and, one way or another, such areas are likely to be difficult.\nAnother kind of resource depletion is regulatory. Drug R&D in the 1950s and 1960s was, compared with today, like the wild west. Regulation and convention has, effectively, built a bunch of fences that stop the drug industry doing things that would, quite rightly, be regarded as risky or unethical, but which made innovation cheaper and easier. \n(2) Doing the wrong things with superficially higher efficiency\nWhat if the technologies and discoveries that were thought to be a drastic improvement on the scientific method were in fact, not that helpful? Had there been an overestimation of the impact of improving basic science? And what if brute-force screening methods weren’t actually increasing the chances of finding more small molecules that would make it all the way through clinical trials?\nThe 2012 paper was an excellent exercise in fleshing out the issues plaguing drug development. As with most things, there was no single factor sabotaging the industry, but rather a coalition of many small and large issues. The paper raised other contributing factors as well – for example, clinical trials are getting bigger and longer too, escalating expenses. \nThe article concluded with a musing about the future; the authors speculated that Eroom’s Law would not hold over the coming years, and it hasn’t. In 2020, _Nature Reviews_ published a[ short follow-up](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00059-3) to the 2012 article, detailing an uptick in drug productivity. The news of Eroom’s Law being broken was wrapped in caution as well as optimism, warning against complacency. More diseases are being genetically segmented, cancer types for example, meaning that while more drugs may be being approved, they are applicable to fewer and fewer people. Rare diseases have also become attractive to pharmaceutical companies as the route to drug approval can be much shorter and/or easier. \nUltimately, Jack’s goal was to trigger a bigger public debate around the issue. With over 1600 citations, Eroom’s Law is certainly being disseminated through the scientific community.\n‍\n## So, how do BioDAOs and Molecule help?\nBy creating a decentralized open-source ecosystem, BioDAOs are circumventing many pitfalls plaguing traditional drug development. Independent reviewers, optimized collaboration, large talent pools, and well-vetted capital allocation all pose effective counters to Eroom’s Law. By utilizing an open-source philosophy and technology that allows for shared governance, productivity is improved.\nBioDAOs also improve the efficiency of idea generation. By removing the geographic layer, experts from around the world are clustered into these communities, providing exceptional resources and support. In doing so, the DAOs can also source a much wider range of ideas, compared to the bubbles that often exist in biotech hubs such as the Bay Area, Boston, or Basel.\nThey also arm researchers with the crucial skill that so many lack; the ability to translate their research into commercial success. Researchers are often not equipped to pitch their ideas to biotech firms, and they shouldn’t need to be. Researchers should be researching. In streamlining this process, drug development should, in theory, improve.\n## What advice does Jack have for researchers looking to get funded via Molecule?\nTwo things. First, consider the provenance or pedigree of your data. Things tend to fail because screening and disease models point us towards the wrong targets or the wrong compounds. More important than your p-values or effect sizes is an honest appraisal of why the p-values and effect sizes in your model systems have any relevance to human therapy. Jack has written another paper here, emphasizing the importance of[ predictive validity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-022-00552-x?error=cookies_not_supported&code=ee5b1440-b66e-4b03-bdfe-896c14b5bfdc), highlighting accurate disease recapitulation. \nSecond, accept that elements of your pet project may be changed in order to make it more likely to succeed. Ultimately, the shared goal is to translate your scientific advancements into practical applications for the benefit of patients. Many of the projects that are pitched at Molecule of the DAOs have the core of a great idea but are untranslatable in their initial form. Be prepared for remodelling when you work with Molecule or the DAOs, particularly if you don’t have much experience of taking drugs from the laboratory and into the clinic.\n‍\n## What’s next for Jack?\nCurrently, Jack is in the process of building a new company with Sir Marc Feldmann and Professor Laura Dugan. The company, Etheros, is set to produce an entirely new class of neuroprotectants, based on research performed by Prof. Dugan. Previously, Sir Marc Feldmann established anti-TNFs, which have subsequently become the best-selling drug class worldwide. \n_A special thanks to Dr Jack Scannell for his time and input while writing this piece._\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/dr-jack-scannell-pharmas-evolving-landscape)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/dr-jack-scannell-pharmas-evolving-landscape)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/dr-jack-scannell-pharmas-evolving-landscape)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Outside of treating hair loss patients, hair loss research is also incredibly under-appreciated as a low-risk human model to understand how regulating various pathways may affect other organs in the human body, given that a hair follicle is essentially a mini organ. Niche research like early stage androgenic alopecia (hair loss) studies receive only about $5.4 million per year from all government agencies globally because of its classification as a “cosmetic condition.” Oftentimes, various studies of science like longevity or hair loss do not receive enough attention because they are not technically classified as “diseases.” These conditions, however, still impact human health in indirect ways as indicated by the high correlation between poor mental health and hair loss. \n[HairDAO](https://www.hairdao.xyz/), a BioDAO that is currently a part of the bio.xyz accelerator, had their first IP-NFT transaction. For $75k, HairDAO will gain access to the initial data from Dr. Ralf Paus’ lab [Cutaneon](https://www.cutaneon.com/). Then, based on the results, HairDAO may opt to test combinations of T3/T4 thyroid hormone at different dosages for an additional $50k. Not only is this the first IP-NFT coming out of the bio.xyz pipeline, but HairDAO will also be the first BioDAO, other than VitaDAO, to be transacting an IP-NFT. \nOn February 16th, the IP-NFT was officially minted and transacted! The etherscan transaction can be viewed [here](https://etherscan.io/nft/0x0dccd55fc2f116d0f0b82942cd39f4f6a5d88f65/1). As per custom, the [transfer ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79FGyptPDY4) occurred with an insightful and exciting conversation between Dr. Paus of Cutanenon, HairDAO founders Andrew Verbinnen and Andrew Bakst, and Benji Leibowitz from Molecule. When asked about his experience of working with HairDAO and receiving funding through an IP-NFT, Dr. Paus expressed that “the approach that was taken was not only creative, it’s also necessary and democratic.” Despite decades of research experience using the traditional science model, Dr. Paus highlights the importance of using decentralized science technology to implement a “business model where the people who have a vested interest in the research should not only able to vote but should also somehow contribute to finding the money that propels the research - that kind of a model makes perfect sense.” Watch the replay for the transfer ceremony below:\nOne of Molecule’s big goals of funding through IP-NFTs is to target typically underinvested areas of science such as longevity or hair loss. These various fields of research impact a large population, but due to limited government funding, certain types of research and studies like clinical trials and cancer-related studies get prioritized in funding allocation. Unlike government funding models, BioDAOs allow for bottom-up rather than top-down funding. They aim to provide a solution for a group of people specifically wanting a solution to hair loss. \n\"What's so cool about minting an IP-NFT in relationship to our research with Professor Paus, is that typically an IP asset like this would get lost in TTO databases, which are incredibly opaque. The IP-NFT makes it easy for any aspiring biotech entrepreneur to purchase IP as easily as they would buy a product on Amazon. That means more biotech spinouts, which means more scientific innovation.\" - Andrew Verbinnen\nThrough the bio.xyz accelerator, Molecule hopes to build communities of researchers, doctors, and patients to fund and govern niche research areas. The combination of BioDAOs and IP-NFTs enable development of therapeutics in various fields that currently remain unexplored. \nIn this particular case with HairDAO’s new IP-NFT, co-founder of HairDAO Andrew Bakst says that blockchain technology, the IP-NFT, enabled “significant efficiency improvements from the wisdom of the crowd provided by the patient-research community.” Even from the perspective of a researcher with a traditional science background, Dr. Paus expresses that this was the “first time ever that [he] had one of his research proposals meticulously scrutinized, publicly vetted, and commented on by a web community of hair aficionados, whose depth of knowledge and understanding of the field [took him by surprise].” \nHairDAO was founded in November 2021 and has already reached the stage of funding its first research project. For this first IP-NFT, voting took place over Discord where there was overwhelming support with 94 ‘yes’ and 2 ‘no’. Another huge stride in the HairDAO roadmap is that they are planning to launch a token ($HAIR) very soon! Using Gnosis Auction, the token will launch on February 23rd and the sale will last for five days. The $HAIR token will enable proportional voting rights over governance, operations, and investment decisions - similar to the model that VitaDAO currently follows. \nHairDAO has a lot more planned such as collecting genomic data for treatment effectiveness predictions as well as selling treatments to the community to use the profits to fund R&D into long-term solutions. There are a lot of big benchmarks to look forward to in the HairDAO community!

Our observations of stress points and confusions (based on the user testers “thinking aloud” while they went through the task) are depicted below:\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62473c65df8e34abedff322a_observations-user-survey-token-bonding-curve.png)\nObservational results based on what user testers were thinking, doing, and saying out loud while they were going through test segments related to the TBC graph.\nThe subjective metrics for the TBC graph highlighted problems of **confusion.** This resulted in misalignment of usability, quality/usefulness of the interface visuals, and the observed understandability:\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62473ca2532776c6f38d33c4_observations-survey-token-bonding-curve.png)\nSubjective metric results based on user testers’ rating of TBC graph, combined with an observational rating of understandability based on follow-up questions for use of TBC graph.\n‍\n_If you want to learn more about Token Bonding curves, read these articles:_\n[Token Bonding Curve Design Parameters](https://www.molecule.to/blog/intimidation-cancels-conversion)\n[An introduction to bonding curves, shapes and use cases](https://www.molecule.to/blog/intimidation-cancels-conversion)\n[ETHCapeTown Hack: Learn to Play with Bonding Curves](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/ethcapetown-hack-learn-to-play-with-bonding-curves-fe44ebaf0bea)\n## Overall Analysis\nMany of our user testers relied on both**recall and recognition** in order to understand the TBC graph and other novel functions that make our product unique. However, it was the combination that resulted in confusions because:\n1) there was not a great amount of information displayed in plain sight, and 2) their past experience of use for any of the functions in our product (especially interpreting the TBC graph) was not extensive enough.\nTherefore, to be able to mitigate these problems a balance will need to be found, whereby there is not a dominant reliance on recall over recognition. This concept is known as the problem of [**cognitive friction**](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/cognitive-friction)**.**\n> Cognitive friction occurs when a user is confronted with an interface or affordance that appears to be intuitive but delivers unexpected results.\n‍\n## Observations\nBelow, is a condensed list of additional observations of both the successes and problems made by the user testers and those we identified:\n  * Showcasing the affiliated universities and their logos validates the projects.\n  * The addition of a “forum section” would create the opportunity for valuable input from externals and a more open-source environment.\n  * Watching the transaction signing in [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/)\n  * **Tutorials/educational content for aspects such as MetaMask and the Token Bonding Curves are needed to clarify any misunderstandings and confusion.**\n  * The interface was very text-heavy, more visuals and graphs will help make information easier to digest.\n\n\n### 4. Our Design Solutions for Web 3.0 UX Optimization\nThrough our testing, we have identified where the needs to offset confusions are, to allow for a simpler interpretation process to optimize UX.\nWe need to **create educational content** on the use of our product highlighting the unique aspects, **enhance recognition** through good use of consistent UI design, and always keep an **open approach** to new ways of displaying technically dense information.\n### Conclusion: Next Steps for Implementation\nUltimately, a point of focus would be to look into the aspects which are **novel to our product** and to **constantly optimize understanding** around those. Therefore, our list of solutions to implement after this round of testing would be:\n  1. **Create a “taxonomy of words” document** so that our language remains not only simple and direct but that the technical terms we use and their definitions remain more consistent and unified throughout the product. This should be made with special attention to all terms around the TBC graphs and key concepts.\n  2. **Compile an instructional guide or learning resource** which will be available to users online. This should be able to provide the necessary education before using the product. This includes adding additional content (in the form of disclaimers, short instructions, descriptions) regarding the use of the product in strategic sections with priority given to the TBC graph while using the product.\n  3. **Create a unique set of branding/aesthetics** for all novel functions on the product (perhaps even MetaMask transactions). This will keep the UI consistent over the product and blend it into the unique experience we would like to create.\n\n\n_In a follow-up article, we will delve into the changes that we implemented specifically for our product.

    "markdown": "![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/64ad11ae96ab5e2bb6a048b9_introducing-ip-tokens-blog-cover.jpg)\n### Introduction\nFive years ago, we started building Molecule around a simple yet powerful idea: **to place patients and researchers at the center of the drug development process**. Our thesis is that [**the fundamental lack of innovation in drug development over the past few decades**](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3681)**is the result of a mechanism and incentive design problem** intrinsic to the market structure and macroeconomics of healthcare.\nAt Molecule, we believe this can be achieved by _changing the rules of the game_ — patients and researchers govern intellectual property (IP) related to a drug alongside (or instead of) a pharmaceutical company, they will behave fundamentally differently with respect to pricing, access, and capital management, prioritizing cures and health outcomes as opposed to profit.\nWith the introduction of **_IP tokens (IPTs)_**_,_ an evolution of the [IP-NFT framework](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm), we are one critical step closer to that reality. **IPTs** are a new way of turning intellectual property into an incentive for collaboration and funding.\nFor the first time, **governance around intellectual property related to a therapeutic can be freely exchanged for funding, collaboration, and support with the click of a button**. This marks the beginning of an era of collaborative, globally interoperable drug development — one where patients, researchers, and funders across the world seamlessly work together to advance drugs to the clinic.\n### The Macroeconomics of IP in Drug Development\nMany talk about prioritizing patients in the drug development process, but few do. Currently, value and innovation in healthcare is driven by ownership in intellectual property that guarantees a [20-year monopoly around a therapeutic innovation](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics). This gives an incentive to innovate, take on risk, and spend the incredibly large amount of capital required to develop a therapeutic and bring it to market. However, this model is not without profound negative implications ranging from anti-competitive behavior to patent trolling and ever-greening, which collectively harm patients. Publicly traded pharmaceutical companies’ primary obligations are to their shareholders, so year-over-year growth in profit tends to be prioritized over all else.\nIn the context of this model, what is a good drug? Well, it is one that requires many sick people to take a drug chronically, ideally for the [rest of their life](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/goldman-sachs-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model/). Disease management is much more profitable than cures, and a “blockbuster drug” is one that many people need to take often. The market has proven this time and time again, as detailed in the report “[Is Curing Disease A Sustainable Business Model](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/goldman-sachs-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model/)”, which chronicles the story of Gilead’s treatment for hepatitis C as an example. We see these stories as intrinsic to the very fabric of the American healthcare system, which indirectly subsidizes healthcare for much of the developed world. We believe that there is a better way, and it starts with **IPTs.**\n### What are IPTs and how do they work?\n**IPTs** are IP governance tokens. They are _synthesized_ using [IP-NFTs](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nft-protocol/intro-to-ip-nft), a digital contract that gives the holder the right to a piece of intellectual property. IPTs govern IP pools: pools of IP and R&D data from scientific research, shared sets of IP-related resources meant to benefit a community by facilitating cooperative management and commercialization of collective IP.\nBut why is this important and why should you care? As I mentioned earlier, IP is the fundamental value driver in drug development, but is intrinsically monopolistic, often stifling innovation. **IPTs** represent a marked advance over the traditional model — instead of a single company or corporation controlling a piece of IP, a variety of disparate stakeholders can control IP based on **funding, work, or support** given to a research project. Similarly, researchers can create **bounties** that enable other researchers and laboratories around the world to contribute data to their project, and in exchange, own governance over the IP that is being developed by the\nThis is a very powerful concept. For years, [experts in innovation have been suggesting the need for new innovation and collaboration models in drug development](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.l4408) and technology development out of universities. Corporate structures and joint-venture agreements have severe limitations and tend to introduce unnecessary friction, particularly in very early collaborations that are high risk and where low administrative and cost overhead is a requirement. Here, IPTs fill the gap, enabling value creation to be shared from the earliest stages of a commercially-oriented research project.\n**IPTs** represents a bridging of worlds — they enable an open-source level of collaboration without losing the commercial opportunity and value-capture known to incentivize progress in traditional legal entities. Combined with the right stakeholder base — patients, researchers, and aligned supporters — **IPTs** creates an arbitrage opportunity in biotech: they give more equity to patients and researchers, in turn resulting in a higher quality research for lower cost. We believe patients and researchers are in it for effective cures, not to make a quick buck.\nWhat exactly do holders of **IPTs** have? Governance — and with it, great responsibility. One major observation we made while developing the BioDAO innovation model is that entity-level incentives (such as BioDAO tokens) are often not enough to power end-to-end drug development. While they can work to incentivize short-term collaboration and actions such as deal sourcing, diligence, and part-time efforts, they are insufficient to push forward individual projects at a high velocity. Whereas BioDAO tokens enable governance over an entire IP portfolio, **IPTs** enable governance over a single project’s IP and R&D data. This opens up new incentive frameworks for more granular levels of collaboration, incentivizing individuals to govern large stakes in projects in a pre-company state. For BioDAOs, it also means new sources of collaboration and liquidity. BioDAOs now have the ability to synthesize **IPTs** from their pre-existing IP-NFT portfolios and encourage new individuals, groups, companies, and even other DAOs, to collaborate with them, all the while accessing new sources of funding for the researcher and the DAO treasury. Collaborators could, for example, earn up to 10% of the IPTs supply in an asset for their collaboration and support, creating a strong incentive to move research forward.\n### What’s Next?\nThe first **IPTs** have already been synthesized. Token holders in the VitaDAO community participated in the VITA-FAST crowdsale for Viktor Korolchuk’s project on Autophagy at the University of Newcastle, which was oversubscribed by more than 1700%! More IPTs will be synthesized on additional projects soon!\nWe will be publishing about the model, first use cases, and all of the new possibilities enabled by IPTs. We are also eager to see what you build with them, and hear your thoughts to strengthen, improve, and iterate the model.\nVisit [vitadao.com](https://www.vitadao.com/) and join their [community](https://discord.com/invite/3S3ftnmZYD) to see the first IPTs in action.\n‍\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/introducing-ip-tokens-ipts-a-new-incentive-for-scientific-collaboration)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/introducing-ip-tokens-ipts-a-new-incentive-for-scientific-collaboration)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/introducing-ip-tokens-ipts-a-new-incentive-for-scientific-collaboration)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Inspired by VitaDAO, an increasing number of BioDAOs have formed, looking to fund research in specific scientific areas. Due to the initial success of the IP-NFT and the DeSci ecosystem's growing interest in adapting the mechanism to more use cases, the Molecule team has been hard at work on a new version of the IP-NFT. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/63a05d9d38e93f048f0c7ed2_HUnRdkC0PGpSk5ayVFzNXJsUZsCYIXw1otrsHwOSvt_4VniSccHFP6_-Em3ry-1wyX4lRIN9c9DNgwzx2CPg-Kk4P8bPWVhTxF2x5AloLYbCDs_n_fNRUiXSPUyoh18ecGH-F8T25rqYc-P_kjXsE0Eoqc1Iq9FEU0HHDvGOQ0_RgnTmIFSEKMrV5j4.png)\n## Enabling collaboration within the DeSci ecosystem\nToday we are excited to introduce the next generation of IP-NFTs: the IP-NFT V2, in closed beta. Version 2 builds on the proven components of the IP-NFT and extends it with new features to service the ever-growing need for novel funding mechanisms in the decentralized science ecosystem. The goal of the V2 is to: \n  * Allow BioDAOs to mint IP-NFTs using a new minting front-end, and\n  * Enable DeSci developers to utilize IP-NFTs within their own infrastructure for dedicated use cases.**‍**\n\n\n## ‍**IP-NFT V2 - How does it work?**\nThe IP-NFT V2 is built with modularity in mind to enable users and builders to tailor their own use cases. In addition, it allows developers to extend its functionality by adding to existing modules or creating completely new ones. Before diving into the different modules, let’s briefly have a look at how Molecule currently executes IP-NFT minting and transacts with the assets. These are the steps required to mint an IP-NFT V2, ordered chronologically: \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/63a05d9d450d4f845d5dcd28_p8nRCWh2MvRFgtJk9VG_aQRUZXMFASVVIZl46lzfptT8gVujU8pEDHGdXXhnHrR7W0po3_JSoEQFamm2U6L0PC1Vcjf6KG_efWFQW1LHgTsjiKOSSqSUoPUHznP6oeohmzmTPtb9l8GkGPIViks4vALfqZHtem8WaxMeWQetLczYDhFXLylE1yHRzgCK.png)\n**1. Legal Agreement Negotiation and Signing (Application Layer):** Two parties negotiate and sign a legal contract that includes two agreements:  \na. **The first agreement** states the rights of the asset holder (dataset, future IP, etc.) and the price paid for the asset. In our case, these agreements are often lined out as Sponsored Research Agreements (SRAs) but they could be any other kind of legal agreement.\nb. **The second agreement** assigns the rights of the buyer within the first agreement to the holder of a certain token of the IP-NFT smart contract. After execution, the token holder becomes the legal counterparty of the agreement.  \n\n**2. Encryption and Storage (Decentralised Storage Layer):** The legal contract containing the two agreements is encrypted with a new symmetric key on the minter’s side and uploaded to a decentralized storage system.   \n\n**3. Storage of decryption key (Access Control Layer):** An access control condition marks holders of the IP-NFT token as being allowed to decrypt the content. The symmetric key from step 3 is encrypted using a threshold cryptography protocol (Lit) so it can only be recovered by a majority of external key shareholders. Thus only the entity that holds the IP-NFT can request a sufficient amount of key shares to reconstruct the encryption key and decrypt the contract associated with the agreement.   \n\n**4. Mint NFT (Ownership Layer):** The IP-NFT is minted using the reserved token ID, data location, access control condition, and the encrypted key. The mint pass must be presented to and redeemed by the IP-NFT contract during this process. \nOnce the IP-NFT is created, it can be traded. For instance, in our example below, Bob will buy the IP-NFT for the amount specified in agreement #1, fulfilling his contractual obligation for funding the research. This guarantees Alice receives the funds and Bob gains access to the signed documents as well as to all data arising from future research.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/63a06d4d518995547a5c36a1_yAy8nxmmG9dM3BFo9G7r4A4Tg4WlEIRRWro9uyOdXHPw3pVbsayNETdidr-rdKC4npsHoaKd7VulEk2IsSFmAQHuVWHwJ_HQpfK1AUeaVOKCcDJTOYQbMi2NOx-ZARmZ1Te3yQ9d0ADtgfIeOPNW-WjpP3NwrWQHbs4Km2hlx6nr-D71eDDbmi0ClWtX.png)\n## ‍**What is new in V2?**\nIP-NFTs work by sticking together decentralized infrastructure, smart contracts, and legal agreements. Developers can decide to exchange some parts of this process with modules they prefer.\nLet’s assume a state or charity sponsors a research project on the condition that the team shares all information openly. In this case, contract documents and all attached research data might be stored unencrypted, rendering the use of an access control module obsolete.  \n  \nThe IP-NFT protocol will be extended even further and Molecule is particularly focused on fractionalizing the assets. Fractionalized IP-NFTs will enable organic community formation to collaborate and collectively govern a certain research asset as it moves through the research and development pipeline. \n## Calling all DeSci Developers & Founders: Get mintpass and start building!\nOver the next months, we are progressively opening up the mint interface for bioDAOs and DeSci collaborators to mint IP-NFTs via our infrastructure. Given the closed beta launch, minters will require a mintpass to interact with our IP-NFT minting infrastructure to help us learn more about how we can improve the infrastructure.   \n  \n[You can apply here and we will get back to you with a mintpass ASAP](https://airtable.com/shr9QN0tPPeK4GGjA).\nLastly, while the Molecule team will continue working on our users’ requested use cases, we are actively opening up our repositories and [documentation](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/) for contributors. We are excited to see what use cases people in the DeSci ecosystem will come up with and we are excited to support them to contribute to an ever-growing tool kit.

In this article, we will dissect these topics with a deep dive into the biopharma funding landscape, how it is evolving, and how researchers can become a part of the next revolution in biomedical research funding.\n## Research — and the eternal quest for funding\nMost researchers would agree that funding (alongside publishing) is a defining aspect of their professional existence. Often, after a decade of training, biomedical researchers who seek a productive career in academia spend a substantial portion of their time trying to attract funding. To emphasise this point, a[ recent study showed](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/5/e002800) that amongst a cohort of 285 biomedical researchers in Australia, an estimated 550 working years of their time was spent preparing proposals. It also showed that preparing a new grant proposal takes an average of 38 working days of researcher time.\nA researcher’s ability to do so dictates the success of their laboratory and further, the path of their career. This funding can come from a variety of sources, but the most prominent sources are[ grants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_%28money%29) funded by taxes (for example, NIH grants in the US). While these sources of funding are often large and consistent, they are difficult to attract and take a long time to deploy. The award rate of NIH grants is[ less than 20%](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/06/29/what-are-the-chances-of-getting-funded/).\n‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62444df0f1129fc2c78217c2_0_AOlCFLoCsqA03SPb.jpeg)\n_Success rates of applicants for R01-equivalent awards, by career stage of investigator._\n## The Valley of Death in Biopharma\nGrant funding of this nature is suitable for basic research and non-commercially oriented work. In drug development however, when a therapeutic is discovered, or research becomes more akin to product development, the[ source of funding must change](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50972/#:~:text=The%20principal%20investors%20in%20drug,pharmaceutical%20companies%20or%20venture%20capitalists.). This is a critical inflection point where innovation often fails, and it is colloquially referred to as the “[valley of death](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/54591)”. This is the point where no-strings-attached funding fails to link up with profit-motivated funding to turn a recent discovery into a product on the market. Surprisingly, one of the[ largest valleys of death lies around our world’s universities](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1758&context=etd). A huge percentage of discoveries made at universities go unutilised, significantly increasing the time until highly anticipated new treatments make it to market, if they reach it at all.\n‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62444f0e07e5782b1ede349e_0_Tn-WZj2nJH5odXCf.jpeg)\nThe Translational “Valley of Death” in Biopharma.\n## Funding and Commercialisation Bottlenecks\nLet’s recap this to fully understand the process. Tax money funds early-stage research in the form of grants. These grants are utilised by researchers to get to the point of developing a potentially life-saving therapeutic. At this point, the technology is often patented, and moved into the holding of a tech transfer office (TTO). In a best case scenario, that technology is out-licensed to a pharmaceutical company and the remainder of the development carries on there. Thus, a public good transitions into a commercial ecosystem where private interests monopolise it. The[ public spends a substantial amount of money indirectly subsidising pharmaceutical development](https://www.vice.com/en/article/vb3d7x/the-nhs-is-paying-for-drugs-twice), to then have a technology taken private and resold to them downstream at a tremendous markup (often referred to as “pay twice”). And this is the best-case scenario. In many cases, the technology fails to be out-licensed, the patent clock ticks, and eventually, the technology withers on the vine, failing to attract its development requirements and never reaching the market, or in the case of drug development, patients.\nThere is another option for researchers and that is to start a company. Many academic researchers however, do not see themselves as entrepreneurs and do not wish to leave their academic posts. Their heart is at the lab after all, rather than in the meeting room\nFurther, much of academic research suffers from discoverability issues. It is often challenging for the demand side of the funding equation to find the right projects, and vice versa. When there is a supply side (research project) and demand side (investor) match, often the challenges of due diligence, legal, and valuation create another group of obstacles that often proves insurmountable.\nWe need stronger alternatives for funding and advancing drug development at universities, and bridging the valley of death. Further, we need an active and involved public — the ultimate beneficiaries of these technologies — to play a stronger role in guiding their development.\nBut how can we enable patients and the public to fund, govern, and own research directly? How can we make IP a more transactable and liquid asset class to generate the funding needed?\n## The IPNFT\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) seem to have exploded out of the ether this year. In the context of the creative industry (mostly art and music), these assets are selling at unprecedented prices.[ OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), one of the most popular NFT trading platforms,[ recently passed $1b in volume](https://cryptotvplus.com/2021/08/nft-marketplace-opensea-hits-milestone-of-1-billion-dollars-in-trade-volume/). The NFT space has been divisive in some ways, but most would agree that the space has been instrumental in helping to usher in a “creator economy”, transferring power away from middlemen and towards creatives themselves. What if a similar revolution was possible in biomedical research — [**a creator economy for scientists**](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/an-open-bazaar-for-drug-development-molecule-protocol-a47978dd914?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------).\nWhile NFTs have gained a lot of publicity related to art, much of the early interest around NFTs related to moving real-world assets on-chain. Molecule has been exploring a use case for combining IP and NFTs with DeFi in 2018, and[ this week, that use case was fully realised](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/announcing-the-first-biopharma-ipnft-transaction-a1ddd4c69d56).\nThumbnail for the first IP-NFT, representing a longevity research project from Morten Scheibye-Knudsen at The University of Copenhagen.\n‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62444f56bf087de3781ada98_0_WM23fKo0SWlQC6_-.png)\nImage associated with the first IP-NFT.\nIn a [historic transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeed1f2f13cf7c93644264e463b6fce07b6bbd54478a4fc02395d38bc0e991d73), the first biopharma IPNFT was successfully transferred to a research collective, VitaDAO, to fund novel longevity therapeutics at the University of Copenhagen. And this is just the beginning.\n‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62444f987d5b013976aa7511_1_AR_LgSrBml-BQqd5RZKkyg.png)\nFirst IP-NFT transaction on Etherscan.\n‍\nOver time, Molecule aims to build a full-fledged funding ecosystem for early-stage research discoveries. Molecule aims to [become an OpenSea of biotech IP](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/an-open-bazaar-for-drug-development-molecule-protocol-a47978dd914), powering a new creator economy for researchers that allows for the rapid funding, discovery, and development of therapeutics through globally connected patient collectives. We believe this system will be equally beneficial to the current pharma industry as it will be for patients: by decentralising access and helping discover promising research more quickly.\nHow will this IP-NFT marketplace work? In brief, it allows the IP to enter Web3. If Web1 is the information layer (think Google), and Web2 is the communication layer (think Facebook and mobile), then Web3 is the monetisation layer that connects Web1 and Web2. Minting IP as an NFT **enables the IP to be financialised** — it can be **held by a DAO, tokenised, have a liquid market created around it, collateralised, and borrowed against**. As an example, one can program funding events into the NFT such that every time someone buys it, X% can go to the inventor. All of these financial tools that either never existed before or that were restricted to sophisticated institutions are now available at everyone’s fingertips thanks to Web3 and DeFi technology. IP-NFTs are also particularly valuable for pre-patent IP such as data, which for all intents and purposes have no market. As an example of this scenario, one can attach a license for future IP rights to a NFT.\n‍\n> This IP-NFT represents full legal IP rights + data access control to biotech research and data at [@ScheibyeKnudsen](https://twitter.com/ScheibyeKnudsen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@uni_copenhagen](https://twitter.com/uni_copenhagen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).  \n>   \n> Purchased for $325,000 & going directly to fund the R&D.  \n>   \n> Virtualised IP is a new asset class.<https://t.co/5wFwpX7A1q><https://t.co/l3zal1TlV3>\n> — Paul Kohlhaas (@paulkhls) [August 17, 2021](https://twitter.com/paulkhls/status/1427725259768205323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n‍\nAn IP-NFT can also be used as an alternative to a patent early on by enabling the protection of data through secure federated data storage, which the NFT unlocks. In this scenario, every time the data is accessed, this can be transparently viewed — its history and ownership record is known and stored on-chain (i.e., on the blockchain, which in VitaDAO’s case means the Ethereum blockchain). Lastly, by making the IP programmable, the IP is more discoverable. This is particularly useful for academic data where there is no efficient way to find it. Programmability also helps create more modular legal contracts.\nFrom the researcher’s perspective, this means that they have an entirely new way to get funded — one where they maintain autonomy, and where a community can directly support them and interact with their research. They can now mint IP-NFTs of their work, and these can be purchased and funded by those that are directly interested in supporting them. Ideally, these purchasers and funders will be DAOs and communities. These communities, like those emerging around [VitaDAO](http://www.vitadao.com/), are interested in interacting with and directly supporting research. Instead of a grant agency or a company, the funding source becomes a network of enthusiastic people who want to engage and learn about the mission. This paradigm shift will completely change the way that biomedical research is funded and advances.\n## Recap: What the IP NFT can do for you\n  1. Fundraise commercially without needing to patent early or create a startup.\n  2. Engage stakeholder groups like patients directly, collaborate with other researchers to promote open science, and get attention through a public marketplace.\n  3. Collaborate on research tasks utilising data access control and bounty systems.\n  4. Create new funding/monetisation strategies that take advantage of data marketplaces.\n\n\n## Conclusion and Outlook\nThe IP-NFT revolution formally kicked off this week in a historical first that will likely change the way biomedical research is funded forever — for the first time, a DAO focused on advancing longevity therapeutics is funding pioneering longevity drug development at a leading university, with full ownership rights to the IP and data generated via an NFT. The scientists working on this project now have a community to actively engage, one that is fully aligned with their vision and mission. And this is just the beginning.\nMolecule is eager to help researchers, labs, biotechs and universities around the world that wish to work this way — particularly, those daring enough to try new things and herald a new era of innovation. We imagine a future where communities and DAOs thrive as key pieces of the biomedical funding infrastructure, and researchers take advantage of decentralised funding opportunities by simply minting their research to IPNFTs. This is a paradigm shift — one towards decentralised, community-focused drug development that allows anyone interested the right to participate. This is the future of biomedical research.\n**_Keen to connect and learn more, discuss or try this approach?_**\nJoin our [Discord](https://discord.gg/jpWE7vGb) to interact directly with our team.\nEmail me at tyler@molecule.\n_Thank you to Molecule, Nevermined, VitaDAO, Tim Peterson, Clemens Ortlepp, Lisa Schwarz, and Paul Kohlhaas for your pioneering work and help with this article._  \n\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

To that end, Molecule created intellectual property non-fungible tokens ([IP-NFTs](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nft-protocol/intro-to-ip-nft)) to enable anyone to hold IP and research and development (R&D) data rights securely on Ethereum. \nGain-of-function research into IP-NFTs had led to a system for further tokenizing them into IPTs. Mintable only by IP-NFT holders, IPTs are an extension of the legal and smart contracts which make up IP-NFTs. \nIPTs represent memberships in an IP pool attached to an IP-NFT. They empower their members to self-organize and jointly develop, validate, license, and sell IP and R&D data assigned to the owner of an IP-NFT.\nBelow, members of Molecule’s legal team describe: (1) IP pooling, (2) the mechanics of creating an IP pool, (3) the rights and responsibilities of IP pool members, and (4) key regulatory themes of antitrust, freedom, securities, and existing IP market challenges. \n### _IP pooling_\nAn IP pool is a set of IP-related resources shared for the benefit of a community. IP pools are powerful tools widely recognized as being [pro-competitive](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/speeches/antitrust-intellectual-property-law-adversaries-partners#N_20_), [efficient](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Open-Source-Insider/Where-is-the-economic-value-of-open-source), and in the [public interest](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01441-2). \nIP pools already exist all around us: \n  1. inside corporations, where employees regularly create IP and exchange data and inventions with each other for collective benefit; \n  2. among biotech firms, where patent pools are administered to solve public health crises (e.g., [Medicines Patent Pool](https://medicinespatentpool.org/what-we-do/licensing-for-public-health));\n  3. in software development, where nearly every tech company uses and generates open source software; and\n  4. with artists and creators, who have licensed over 2 billion works under Creative Commons licenses. \n\n\nBy creating tokenized IP pools using IPTs, BioDAOs can cooperatively manage their collective IP, co-governing its development and commercialization. Pool members’ rights can be limited by rules set through token holder governance such as requiring know-your-customer (KYC) disclosures and non-disclosure agreement (NDA) signatures in order to access sensitive data. \nIPTs use adhesion contracts to attach rights to tokens. Widely used in tech as terms of use, in crypto adhesion contracts are [token wrapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkwrap_\\(contract_law\\)) agreements and IP licenses, e.g. the [CryptoPunks Terms](https://licenseterms.cryptopunks.app/). Adhesion contracts adhere to IPTs, imbuing token holders with IP rights. \n### _The mechanics of creating an IP pool_\nThe first step in creating an PT pool is minting an [IP-NFT](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nft-protocol/intro-to-ip-nft). \nWhen minting an IP-NFT, a user attaches a legal contract to a smart contract, such as a sponsored research agreement granting rights to IP and R&D data from scientific research. This is done using [mint.molecule.to](https://mint.molecule.to/), which generates a NFT denoting ownership on a distributed ledger. \nThe next step is minting IPTs using the IP-NFT. To do so, the IP-NFT owner uses their token to transact with a second smart contract that enables the IP-NFT owner to mint new tokens: IPTs. \nIPTs are fungible tokens unique to their parent IP-NFT. For example, IPTs of VitaDAO’s “Discovering Novel Autophagy Activators’’ IP-NFT funding the Viktor Korolchuk Lab at Newcastle University will be different from IPTs of VitaDAO’s ApoptoSENS IP-NFT funding Amit Sharma’s work on Senolytic CAR-NK Cells.\n![Creating an IPT pool using Molecule](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/64b0374ec7ef96b9f2810b0d_BioDAO%20Tokenizing%20IP.png)\n### _The rights and responsibilities of IP pool members_\nIPTs are memberships in an IP pool governed by the Free Association of IPTs Membership Agreement (\"Membership Agreement\"). The Membership Agreement is an adhesion contract giving token holders the following rights and responsibilities:\n  * Governance: Token holders have the right to participate in the governance of the IP-NFT and its development. This includes voting on proposed licenses and use of proceeds from the IP-NFT. \n  * Access to Intellectual Property: Token holders have access to relevant data and IP arising from the development of the IP-NFT, with KYC/NDA required (unless otherwise governed by the token holders) to access sensitive data. This is necessary for due diligence and to govern the development of the IP-NFT intelligently. However, this does not grant any license to the IP.\n\n\n  * Duty of Care: Token holders have a Duty of Care to honor, support, and adhere to the terms and conditions of the Membership Agreement, including any governance agreement made pursuant to it.\n  * Confidentiality: Token holders must not, without consent, use or disclose any confidential information or IP for any purpose or attempt to sell or register any Confidential Information, IP, or R&D data rights developed through their participation in the token holder group. \n\n\nFor the legal contract to adhere, token holders encounter and agree to it in several places: at the point of purchasing their IPTs in the original sale, when voting with their IPTs in governance decisions, when accessing private data rooms for the IP pool, and when claiming any proceeds from licensing or sale of the IP-NFT, IP, and R&D data. \nThese points of encounter help to ensure that the duty of care over the IP pool and its governance is upheld prior to any token holder being able to claim proceeds. For example, in the event of a bad actor, the IP-NFT owner can challenge the right of the actor to receive any proceeds in view of the bad actor’s failure to uphold a reasonable duty of care.\nHolders of IPTs control the IP licensing function of the IP pool. Free to govern their IP pool and the terms upon which IP and R&D data in the IP pool gets distributed, holders could vote to issue a license for a drug patent to a pharmaceutical company, voting on the license terms and the distribution of proceeds from licensing or sale of the drug, as well as the conditions for distribution, such as KYC and accreditation requirements for people to claim them. \n### _Key Regulatory Themes_\nIn this final section, we delve into the three key regulatory themes pertaining to the use of IPTs in IP pools: antitrust, freedom, and securities. We conclude by reviewing how IPTs can help solve existing IP market challenges. \n### _Antitrust_\nThe history of antitrust action in IP pooling goes back as far as the [Sewing Machine War of the 1850s](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228159028_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_First_American_Patent_Thicket_The_Sewing_Machine_War_of_the_1850s), when manufacturers pooled patents to gain market power over one of the earliest mass-manufactured machines. Regulators of the [Sewing Machine War](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228159028_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_First_American_Patent_Thicket_The_Sewing_Machine_War_of_the_1850s) found that the manufacturers’ pool of sewing machine technology patents [slowed the pace of innovation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227405098_Do_Patent_Pools_Encourage_Innovation_Evidence_from_the_Nineteenth-Century_Sewing_Machine_Industry) in the market. \nToday, regulators' [default assumption is actually the inverse](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/speeches/antitrust-intellectual-property-law-adversaries-partners#N_20_): that IP pooling creates market efficiencies wherever it’s deployed. In fact, [numerous IP case studies](https://maps.org/news/bulletin/can-we-have-a-psychedelic-patent-system/) have shown that aggressive individual IP ownership, rather than pooled IP ownership, stifles innovation and creates anti-competitive markets which harm patients through higher costs of drugs. Pooled IP ownership can have pro-competitive effects that benefit patients and promote innovation. For example, IP pooling through open-source software standards like Linux and Apache have contributed to the growth of the internet and lowered costs for web developers, benefitting web users. In biotech, this means faster paths to market and lower costs for patients. \nIn an IP pool created by the owner of an IP-NFT minting IPTs, holders of IPTs control the licensing function as well as proceeds distribution. Together, IPT holders program the terms upon which IP, R&D data, and economic proceeds from the IP-NFT gets distributed. In order to prevent bad actors from accessing the pool, IPT holders can govern in access restrictions, such as KYC and NDAs, for their pool-controlled IP and R&D data. \n### _Freedom_\nIP pooling is an exercise of freedom of contract that requires no special permits or governmental registrations. It also advances the purpose of the IP system, which in the United States is to promote “Progress.” The [Progress Clause of the Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C8-1/ALDE_00013060/#:~:text=Article%20I%2C%20Section%208%2C%20Clause,their%20respective%20Writings%20and%20Discoveries.&text=See%20Act%20of%20Apr.) (also known as the Copyright Clause or the Intellectual Property Clause) predicates the existence of an IP system on its purpose of “promot[ing] the Progress of Science and useful Arts.”. \nThe Progress Clause recognizes that IP rights are not absolute and that they must be balanced against the public interest in developing culture, innovation, and scientific knowledge. IP pools promote this balance by encouraging collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and resources, which can lead to greater innovation and more broadly accessible technologies built for the public good. \n### _Securities_\nIn the development of the legal architecture of IP-NFTs and IPTs, we engaged with three independent law firms for their professional assessments. According to their evaluations, it is likely that in jurisdictions such as the U.S. and Switzerland, IP-NFTs would not be classified as securities. However, they indicated that IPTs could potentially fall under securities classification if they were to grant hard-coded economic rights to proceeds from IP-NFTs. \nAs a result, we designed IPTs to serve as memberships in IP pools. Members must govern in economic rights, carefully weighing the options in doing so as is happening today in discussions around distributions of protocol proceeds to holders of [UNI tokens](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/making-protocol-fees-operational/21198) from the decentralized exchange Uniswap, [ARB tokens](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/distribution-of-dao-revenue-to-arb-token-holders/14412) from Ethereum layer 2 Arbitrum, and [LDO tokens](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-introducing-ldo-staking/4636) from liquid staking protocol Lido. \nMemberships in IP pools have not, to our knowledge, been treated as securities in any given jurisdiction worldwide. Despite their design as memberships in IP pools, IPTs face regulatory uncertainty around cryptographic tokens. Great minds argue that [cryptographic tokens are by their very nature not securities](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4282385). Rather, securities transactions happen when people make investment contracts for them. For example, in the famous [Howey case the underlying things being sold were oranges. Oranges are not securities, but the way that shares of the orange harvests](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/293/) were being distributed and promoted by W.J. Howey Co. created investment contracts. Investment contracts are securities. [Whisky barrels](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1973/100873owens.pdf) have also been considered securities when [sold as investments](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1973/100873owens.pdf). \nTherefore, anyone who mints IPTs from an IP-NFT should be aware before distributing them that whether they qualify as securities will depend on the manner of distribution in a case by case analysis. Minters should use caution regarding token marketing, consider excluding U.S. participants from any token sale, and if selling IPTs as investments then access the markets only using [securities exemptions](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/dont-run-afoul-of-securities-laws), as well as seek advice from independent legal counsel. \n### _Existing IP market challenges_\nThe existing IP system is plagued by [market challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241736622_Inefficiencies_in_markets_for_intellectual_property_rights_Experiences_of_academic_and_public_research_institutions). [Low-quality patents](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/evolving-ip-marketplace/rwagner2.pdf), [IP trolls](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/07/22/the-growing-problem-of-us-patent-trolls-and-what-should-happen-next/?sh=366dc65e15c8), [efficient infringement](https://hbr.org/2022/08/big-tech-has-a-patent-violation-problem), and unethical commercialization of IP have led to a choir of lobbying for IP reform. Competing interests among lobbyists from [Big Tech](https://www.wired.com/2015/07/google-facebook-amazon-lobbying/) and [Big Pharma](https://readsludge.com/2023/03/09/pfizer-spends-big-on-ip-lobbying-with-billions-on-the-line/) have created regulatory paralysis. [84% of patents](https://usinventor.org/assessing-ptab-invalidity-rates/#:~:text=The%20net%20result%20is%2084,have%20all%20challenged%20claims%20invalidated.) that have been submitted to the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) and undergone full review are found to be at least partially invalid. When there is valid, enforceable IP, inventors often [lack any moral rights](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3716247) to ensure that their drugs are commercialized ethically.\nIPTs are designed to solve existing IP market challenges. Here are some examples of how:\n  * Empower patient community to co-govern drugs to ensure they get commercialized in the public interest (e.g. price caps on drugs and therapies, equal pay and commitments to ethical supply chains, fair compensation to inventors/researchers, etc.)\n  * Co-manage and co-fund IP enforcement necessary to prevent “[efficient infringement](https://ipwatchdog.com/2017/03/17/tech-ruling-class-stifles-innovation-efficient-infringement/id=79391/)” by powerful market actors (e.g., BigTech and BigPharma wielding dominant market power to infringe IP without meaningful consequences) \n  * Utilize on-chain transparency in IP ownership and licensing to decrease due diligence costs in IP transactions (e.g., [Smart Transactions](https://ipwe.com/smart-transactions-marketplace/)).\n  * Operationalize the theoretical benefits of decentralized patent examination and IP validation proposed by legal academics (e.g., [Decentralized Patent System](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3447066))\n  * Utilize established collective-action IP risk-management strategies such as anti-troll license-on-transfer IP encumbrances (e.g. [LOT Network](https://lotnet.com/)) and defensive patent aggregation (e.g. [RPX](https://www.rpxcorp.com/))\n  * Use decentralization of IP and R&D data to break down [IP silos](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/05/12/overcoming-data-silos-in-your-organization/?sh=67f529e5628a) that create duplicative scientific research and inefficient IP development \n\n\nAs leaders [question](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ERP-2023.pdf) whether distributed ledger technology can be used to create economic benefits, one need not look any further than tokenized IP. Tokenized IP unlocks liquidity and transparency in a historically opaque market. \nIPT-enabled pools distribute governance, decentralizing control over the IP licensing function and distributions of proceeds, unlocking a new means for efficiently managing biotech IP risk, facilitating early stage capital formation for scientific research, and empowering people to have more power in therapeutics development.\nIn conclusion, the innovative use of IP-NFTs and IPTs presents a significant opportunity for biotech organizations like BioDAOs to securely and efficiently manage intellectual property. These digital tools offer a promising solution to the challenges plaguing the current IP market, fostering collaboration, competition, and innovation. The introduction of tokenized IP pools can empower communities to collectively govern and commercialize their IP, contributing to greater transparency, liquidity, and returns on investments. However, the path forward requires careful navigation of potential regulatory uncertainties, particularly around securities law. As we continue to explore and refine these technologies, the future of IP management in the biotech sector looks more decentralized and democratized.\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ipts-a-gain-of-function)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ipts-a-gain-of-function)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ipts-a-gain-of-function)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

In an effort to negate these effects, [VitaDAO](https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/29/first-transmitted-alzheimers-disease-cases-growth-hormone-cadavers/), a key player in Decentralized Science, has partnered with [Dr. Michael Torres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljasontorres) and [Artan BIO](https://www.artan.bio/) to engineer a first-in-class therapy that aims to suppress deleterious codon mutations. The VitaDAO community voted to provide [$91,300 worth of funding to Dr. Torres](https://mint.molecule.to/ipnft/28) via Molecule’s Intellectual Property Non-Fungible Token (IP-NFT) protocol. To increase the opportunity for community involvement and further funding, the IP-NFT will be tokenized into Intellectual Property Tokens (IPTs), granting governance privileges to IPT holders in the VitaDAO community and beyond. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/65cb50a16fbdec3faf8c5936_PYRns1lvQDEGK9Hlll1tbjyC9ZgzULJR5VI0rRpGhO8V4mqpHapuu1EWYCqB5bhZFjBRSyDsx-u21NwQ9Ksg90lEAN9AF1tVBAvaw-6p7esYpSVmXVK9aX1FMRN2TlQei7z2_PtP7HY_rlwRI4y3niQ.png)\n‍\n## What happens when DNA gets up to nonsense?\nThe ribosome, colloquially known as our protein printer, is continually walking itself down strands of genetic code, reading each building block like braille, and then summoning the corresponding amino acids, with the help of transfer RNA (tRNA). These amino acids string together, ultimately forming proteins. If a single building block, known as a nucleotide, mutates, it can alter the protein being created. Our proteins participate in every possible shade of bodily function, so changes in protein synthesis tend to cause a whole host of problems. \nOne such nucleotide change results in mutations known as **nonsense mutations**. They occur when a single nucleotide mutates and forms a stop codon, which is effectively a force-eject button. Stop codons are generally reserved for the end of the entire protein sequence when the protein is ready to be sent off into the body, but in the case of nonsense mutations, these stop codons accidentally crop up elsewhere. When this happens, protein formation is halted prematurely, resulting in half-formed, non-functional proteins which can go on to cause mayhem in the body. Finding and correcting nonsense mutations is not a novel concept. In fact, our bodies do it already! However, we’re far from perfect - issues arise when genuine stop codons are recognized as well, and overridden when they should not be. Currently, the existing treatments _also_ fall prey to this issue. \n‍\n## The Science\nTo address the gap, Dr. Torres has invented a potential solution; an engineered system to suppress the outcome of a particular nonsense mutation, enabling the continuation of protein formation. His solution is unique in so far that it appears to be more discerning than other treatments, correctly identifying the problematic stop codon while ignoring genuine stop codons, and most importantly, not interfering with normal gene translation. Preliminary data produced in collaboration with [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) has supported Dr. Torres’ hypothesis, leading to VitaDAO’s decision to fund further investigation. \nAdditionally, Dr. Torres has identified a delivery system that is adept at sneaking into cells in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system. By integrating the engineered codon suppressor into this vector, he suspects that it will be the perfect vehicle to carry the therapeutic to exactly where it needs to go. This vector comes with the bonus of already being clinically validated, which enables the team to optimize its path to first-in-human studies, as certain risks have already been addressed. \n‍\n## The Scientist\nDr. Torres, who holds a PhD in Cancer Biology from [UT-Southwestern](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/) in Dallas, has previously co-founded [ReCode Therapeutics](https://recodetx.com/), a clinical-stage genetic medicines company that has secured over $300M in funding. He now works as the CEO of CrossBridge Bio, an oncology-focused company focused on developing next-generation dual payload antibody-drug conjugates. Dr. Torres was introduced to Decentralized Science (DeSci) by longtime DeSci supporter Mike Baran from [Pfizer Ventures](https://www.pfizer.com/about/partners/venture-investments), and was quickly attracted to the ability to leverage community engagement to critically evaluate and fund ideas. His extensive experience in drug development, as well as his aptitude for both science and entrepreneurship, make him the perfect candidate for VitaDAO and Molecule’s novel funding model.\n> _“In essence, this model is a powerful tool for transforming ideas into tangible data, supporting future drug development, and creating valuable societal assets.” Dr. Michael Torres_\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/65cb53650b5f3ee17941b66d_torres.jpg)\n‍\n## A single solution for many diseases\nAs a seasoned drug developer, Dr. Torres understands the importance of having foresight when in the lab. In studying nonsense mutations, Dr. Torres observed that a specific nonsense mutation is prevalent in many proteins involved in cellular processes associated with aging such as DNA repair, epigenetic regulators, and tumor suppressors. As this mutation is conserved across many diseases, several clinical opportunities are possible. Under optimal conditions, this research has the potential to turn into a ubiquitous therapy that could be used to treat several health issues associated with aging. VitaDAO is particularly interested in the potential of a therapeutic that could reactivate tumor-suppressing proteins in cancer patients, aiming to slow down or even eradicate tumor growth, given their focus on age-related diseases. Some of the other diseases implicated with nonsense mutations are Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, metabolic diseases, and neurologic disorders. \n‍\n## About VitaDAO\n[VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/) is a community-owned collective dedicated to funding and advancing longevity science that can improve people's lives. They have a strong presence in the Decentralized Science community and have utilized the IP-NFT model multiple times. In addition to this, together with Molecule and Dr. Viktor Korochuk, VitaDAO launched the first tokenized research project in the form of IPTs. The IPT tokens, known as [VITA-FAST](https://mint.molecule.to/ipnft/2) have enabled direct community governance - a world first. \n[Dr. Anthony Schwartz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyschwartzphd/), a VitaDAO Entrepreneur in Residence, will act as the project manager for this project. He has founded at least 15 startups, primarily focused on autoimmune diseases and cancer, which have led to large financings and an FDA-approved product. He is also a lecturer at Johns Hopkins. \n> _“The emerging VitaDAO model can potentially change how new drugs are funded. I'm excited and motivated to help bring that model to fruition through VitaDAO's funding of new companies and blockchain capital raises (IP-NFT/IPT) and seamlessly transition these companies into traditional VC/Pharma financing to bring new drugs to the market.” Dr. Anthony Schwartz_\n‍\n## What is an Intellectual Property Non-Fungible Token?\nIntellectual Property Non-Fungible Tokens (IP-NFTs) bring IP rights, such as the right to data and patents from drugs developed by funded research, onchain by attaching IP rights to smart contracts. By unifying data and intellectual property rights into programmable, transactable, blockchain tokens, IP-NFTs represent an evolutionary step in the development and management of scientific research IP. To date, IP-NFTs have been used to register IP of more than $1.95M in scientific research. The Torres IP-NFT adds to this growing list. You can find the IP-NFT [here](https://mint.molecule.to/ipnft/28). \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/65cb4ffce37ed272a2f56391_5A4oe9e2vhy4c22w5CV6t_aO_TblYZb_8yhKHcjuxRgbpWKyGKKOM1dq8vOmbAdxbhqZ64rNyjtgCkzF0KpCPQmYM-qawgqpXYLU76Lb-rPPoy_MqevzpEvblfanGwgaHeFkmZ-jdHNCMoLv2pxLqS8.png)\n_The IP-NFT artwork created to visually represent the project_ ‍\n‍\n## Intellectual Property Tokens invite the community to participate \n> _“This revolutionary concept of IP tokenization allows community involvement in the drug development process, creating a mutually beneficial situation. For us, it enables unlocking additional capital in a collaborative manner. For the community, it gives them an opportunity to directly support projects in a manner previously unavailable.” Dr. Michael Torres_\nTrue to the belief of equitable and accessible scientific research, VitaDAO will be tokenizing the Torres IP-NFT into IPTs, fungible tokens enabling the distribution of IP rights to their holders, in order to raise funds for the science and empower the community to govern the resulting IP. \nFunding from sales of the IPTs will enable Dr. Torres and his team to insert the engineered fragment into the chosen vector and perform _in vitro_ testing to validate its effectiveness. IPTs will enable individuals to actively govern the project and its results, such as new drugs developed from the team’s research. \nGranting community members the power to co-develop research projects harnesses the potential of incentive-aligned expertise, furthering decentralized science. Many decisions need to occur as this project unfolds, such as which other possible delivery vehicles to test, which disease indication is best suited for clinical testing, and how to raise additional funds. With the power of IP tokenization, the wisdom of the crowd now has the chance to influence those decisions. \n‍\n#### [Join VitaRNA Crowdsale ](https://mint.molecule.to/ipnft/28/crowdsale/11898943965420002506843917109499600239839980756220809490921404888324468956558)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/decentralized-funding-to-combat-nonsense-mutations)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/decentralized-funding-to-combat-nonsense-mutations)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/decentralized-funding-to-combat-nonsense-mutations)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Over the past two years, intellectual property (IP) tokens have evolved from theory to reality. We’ve seen DAO-led biotech funds take shape, early-stage projects tokenize their research, and entire scientific communities begin to organize around programmable IP. But navigating this emerging landscape has been difficult due to fragmented information and limited visibility. That’s about to change. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/680a7591c462cfd33ec49c87_AD_4nXe0qrFGgYakdvBtyqnUCzIXedt3HzPPx7kah3qI4gdX8_Lh6-oKeHlfP4PbKs0E8Ab_QNHMYTQwuZiblm4rluzvAeMxzMFmcHG717SwOFezHZXerJqrdzbhHLppjbhTvMbNKm9E2w.png)\n## Your New Command Centre for Decentralized Science\nWe’ve rebuilt Molecule from the ground up to serve as a **discovery engine for tokenized scientific IP**. \n  * **Explore the IP token ecosystem  \n** Search by research areas or filter by chain. Quickly surface trending projects and market movements.  \n\n  * **Trade IP tokens directly  \n** Connect your wallet and seamlessly manage your tokenized IP portfolio all in one place.  \n\n  * **Track token data, volume, and holders  \n** Get real-time insights into what’s moving - and who’s backing it.  \n\n  * **Dive deeper into projects  \n** Understand the science, funding, and communities behind every token.\n\n\nIt’s a simple interface representing an emerging ecosystem. And it’s built not just for today, but ready to grow along DeSci itself. \n## Built for the Community, Shaped by the Community.\nExploring scientific IP tokens should be as intuitive as browsing DeFi protocols or an NFT marketplace. That means making the ecosystem data visible, understandable, and actionable - not fragmented and buried in PDFs or block explorers. It means helping curious researchers become contributors, helping token holders become stewards, and helping scientific communities coordinate around shared incentives.\nWe’re starting simple: a clear map of the IP token ecosystem, updated in real-time, available to everyone. But we’re building toward much more.\nWe’re launching this as a public beta—open access, open feedback, open collaboration. Whether you already hold IP tokens or you're simply DeSci-curious, [we want your input](https://moleculeprotocol.typeform.com/to/v98ECnhB) to shape the future of this platform. Start exploring [Molecule.xyz](https://www.molecule.xyz/).\n## About Molecule\nMolecule is dedicated to advancing scientific research through democratized funding and the tokenization of intellectual property (IP).

Here, our Chief Scientific Officer,_[_Tyler Golato_](https://twitter.com/GolatoTyler) _, discusses why_[ _Molecule_](https://www.molecule.to/) _is doubling down on longevity._\n## The Importance of Longevity\nThroughout human history, the idea of slowing down the aging process has captivated our imaginations and piqued our collective curiosities. There exists an enduring sentiment that the aging process is inescapable; like death, growing old is intrinsic and inseparable from life. Human progress in the realm of hygiene and medicine has led to expectations of leading a long life, and consequently, expectations of reaching an old age. However, until recently, becoming aged was a rarity; for most of our human existence, age itself was not a risk factor for death.\nThis changed with advancements in antibiotics and the ability to combat communicable diseases, which led to a more than 50% increase in human life expectancy since 1900. This rapid increase in human life expectancy over the past 100 years outpaces the increase in life expectancy from the previous 2000 years. [For 99% of human history, the average life expectancy was between 25–30 years](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy). However, living longer and growing older has had broad societal consequences. Today, age-related pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration are among the leading causes of mortality and disability. To combat this, we must achieve a greater understanding of the aging process, which mechanistically underpins all age-related diseases. A greater understanding underpinning the biology of aging will lead to broader therapeutic strategies to target the aging process itself.\nThe global elderly population is projected to substantially increase throughout the 21st century.\n![molecule tackles ageing and longevity](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/624718a5f9bdd967a0cd0161_molecule-tackles-aging.png)\nMolecule tackles ageing.\nTherefore, interventions that ensure healthy aging are of critical importance. While recent decades have unearthed significant knowledge regarding the molecular basis of aging, interventions targeting aging are only just beginning to emerge.\nTo this end, several therapeutic regimens have shown exceptional promise in retarding aging in model organisms, and for the first time, this knowledge is beginning to be applied to human beings (de Cabo and Madeo, 2014). Whereas aging was once thought of as merely an unprogrammed series of largely random deleterious events, we have now identified genes and pathways that promote longevity. It is now known that specific cellular pathways likely underpin the aging process (Burgess, 2012). The field of biogerontology is undergoing a renaissance, with an explosion of interest and investment over the past decade.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/624718ff33ee1460bfd0b1b6_molecule-dao-and-ageing-longevity.jpeg)\n## The Emergence of a New Therapeutic Space\nThe longevity space itself has matured tremendously over the past 10 years. While we are finally beginning to understand the key factors that drive aging and are actively developing biomarkers that measure age, we still have a lot of work to do before there is a widely-available therapy that’s proven to increase lifespan. Some of the brightest minds in the field see these therapies on the horizon — SENS’ Dr. Aubrey de Grey believes one will be available within 20 years.\nAt this point, we know enough about the aging process to design new therapies that could have an unprecedented impact on aging. It’s now a routine procedure to reverse the aging of human cells in the laboratory dish.\nThe field of aging is growing fast — there are now over 100 companies dedicated to the research and product development in areas of senolytics, telomeres, stem cells, mitochondria, and gene editing. These are some of the core domains from which therapies that increase lifespan will emerge. You can learn more about many of the companies in the longevity space by checking out Karl Pfleger’s website, <https://agingbiotech.info/companies/>.\nThe development of a drug therapy that extends life is summarised by much of the ongoing work in [senolytics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405395/), telomeres, stem cells, mitochondria, DNA damage and repair, and gene editing. At present, [extending lifespan is a well-characterised theoretical case with some practical applications in model organisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6678192/) such as fruit flies, roundworms, and [mice](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/08/a-list-of-interesting-longevity-enhancement-methods-in-mice/). However, the leap to humans is a significant barrier. On the other hand, prospects have never been better. There are numerous global developments ongoing in the space with many well-funded companies and universities working towards using these techniques to treat disease, as well as slow-down or halt aging.\nClinical trials of drug therapies that extend life are difficult to launch due to aging’s characterisation as a non-pathological (not a disease). This is beginning to change, but at present, most drugs being studied for their effect on the aging process are being tested in clinical trials by targeting other indications. If a drug is being trialled to cure breast cancer, then, of course, it affects the recipient’s lifespan and could be classified as a longevity therapeutic. This represents the current divide between Longevity and Healthcare, and a barrier that we need to collectively overcome. Thus, the progress of drugs in clinical trials that treat aging as a disease is the core focus. Of the 120+ companies designated to developing Longevity therapies, 68 are pre-clinical, while only 3 are at Phase 3 clinical trials.\nIndication expansion is the use of approved drugs in Longevity applications. Metformin and Rapamycin are the best known in this category.\nMetformin is a medicine to treat type 2 diabetes and is being used in the [2020+ TAME trial](https://www.afar.org/tame-trial) to see if it does actually treat the diseases of aging; while the latter is a drug that prevents organ transplant rejection (and also slows Alzheimer’s in rats). Rituximab is a drug for the treatment of lymphomas, leukaemia, and some autoimmune disorders. Interestingly, through observation, doctors determined that if a stroke victim is on rituximab, their chance of having dementia is lower. Indication expansion is both fascinating, but risky in terms of prescribing a drug for a condition the patient doesn’t have. Many therapeutics are still at the animal study stage, but in general, this area shows the most near-term promise in generating viable pro-longevity therapeutics.\n## Molecule and Longevity\nMolecule is interested in longevity research because of the broad promise it offers towards defeating age-related disease and helping us to live longer, healthier, and more robust lives. Most of the chronic diseases that pose the most significant threat to our mortality are age-related. Conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, and arthritis are largely responsible for the rapid decline humans tend to experience during the last 10–15 years of life. These diseases are responsible for the majority of costs experience by our global healthcare system. Longevity therapeutics offer the promise of preventing these diseases, and with it, the ability to age more gracefully and live like a young person, even in old age.\n[ARDD 2020: Addressing the challenges in drug discovery](https://www.longevity.technology/ardd-2020-addressing-the-challenges-in-drug-discovery/)\nAt Molecule, we see longevity as an entirely new approach to medicine; one that has the potential to prevent, as opposed to treat or intervene. This approach will completely change the way the world approaches medical care and will have a profound impact on society. This also begs the question — who should control access to such vital therapeutics? Who should profit from them? Our core thesis relates to the democratisation and decentralisation of drug development, and most importantly, the democratisation of ownership. We are working to make the financing and ownership of longevity molecules public and democratic — we believe the cure for aging and the prevention of age-related disease should belong to all of us.\nIn a few short weeks, we will be launching one of our flagship longevity projects with one of the most brilliant minds in biogerontology. This project comes to us from the University of Copenhagen’s Center for Healthy Aging, and will focus on the creation of novel therapies to directly target the aging process. We will be coordinating the financing of this project, and distributing equity to parties and individuals interested in owning a part of the future of longevity therapeutics. We are extremely excited to support this project and help make the creation of therapeutics to combat aging a reality.\n![The 7th Aging Research and Drug Discovery Conference 2020](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/624719b582ae3ae1f4903014_The%207th%20Aging%20Research%20and%20Drug%20Discovery%20Conference%202020.png)\nThe 7th Aging Research and Drug Discovery Conference 2020\nWe will be working with some of the leading experts in the longevity space, and if successful, the project could generate multiple therapies to extend human life. This project is in the early pre-clinical stages, but we already have robust human data suggesting that these compounds extend human lifespan. We will be making an announcement with more details of the project soon.

A partnership between Molecule, a central player in the growing Decentralized Science (DeSci) ecosystem, and Nucleate, a leading organization in the development of biotech leaders, is a novel opportunity to engage and educate the scientific community about innovative ways to fund their cutting-edge research. Molecule’s unique decentralized funding infrastructure enables this synergistic alliance, connecting a global network of drug hunters, academics and science enthusiasts across the world, united in the common goal of advancing high-quality biomedical research. \nNucleate and Molecule share a common culture of innovation. Like Nucleate, Molecule’s vision for the future of life sciences is where intellectual property value is shared by researchers, entrepreneurs and patients alike. DeSci is the mechanism through which this vision can come to fruition. Its principles of incentive alignment, community engagement, and human-centricity are critical in moving the needle of change forward. \nMolecule has created a legal & smart contract platform called an intellectual property non-fungible token (IP-NFT). The IP-NFT facilitates the assignment of IP rights to blockchain-based tokens, enabling the legal rights, data access, and economics around research projects to be seamlessly funded and traded. Leveraging this technology, Molecule is building an ecosystem of scientific supporters eager to fund researchers, and the partnership with Nucleate is instrumental in connecting researchers with this community.\n> _“We are thrilled to partner with Nucleate and to support the next generation of biotech leaders. Through this partnership, we hope to expand the reach of decentralized science to every campus in the world, and build on what is already the largest global community of bio innovators.”_ Tyler Golato, Molecule CEO\n‍\n> _“We couldn’t be more excited to be partnering with Molecule to enable translation of research from the University to the real world through community engagement. Through this partnership, we are proud to empower the next generation by launching the Nucleate - Molecule Venture Fellowship which aims to train students in the field of venture building while simultaneously increasing the number of academic research projects that lead to commercialization.”_ Sammi Sison, Nucleate’s Co-President\n‍\n## Venture Fellows\nTen candidates will be selected from a global pool of Nucleate fellows for the Venture Fellows program in 2024, and will undergo thorough education in two key areas: the essentials of IP funding via Molecule’s token-based model, and the principles of Decentralized Science (DeSci). Equipped with this knowledge, they will support selected research projects to successfully showcase their science and secure funding via Molecule’s platform. The fellowship will last for 6 months, in which time the Venture Fellows will participate in deal flow discussions with researchers and university technology transfer offices (TTOs), scientific reviews of projects, product development, and community engagement. By the end of the fellowship, the candidates will have been exposed to many of the challenges facing early stage researchers, and will be well positioned to tackle them in the next stage of their careers. \nApplications for 10 positions are now open, and those interested in applying can check out the job description [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lbrqerJiU-LsxOsT3OazzqIpwMIgUTKS/view?usp=drive_link) and submit their CV and cover letter [here](https://airtable.com/appwwHbo0hvTdvVKY/pagyakpueq1Fc9514/form). Applications from European candidates will close at the end of March, and applications from candidates in the U.S. and Taiwan will close at the end of April. \n‍\n## The $100K DeSci Award\nIn addition to the partnership, Molecule has created a $100,000 DeSci Award that will be granted to a research program sourced and tokenized by a Nucleate Fellow. The money will ensure that the deserving project will have sufficient resources to advance to its next value inflection point. Molecule will also assist the winning team in spinning out their asset with IP-NFT formation and tokenization to further increase the ability of the DeSci ecosystem to participate in its development. \n‍\n## About Molecule\nMolecule enables funding at the earliest stages of translational research. Molecule’s products make IP effortlessly transactable through tokenization, enabling an incentive-aligned, community-driven approach to address inefficiencies in the translational research pipeline. Simply put, Molecule is building a future where smart people with good ideas can quickly fund and successfully de-risk them with community support. Since 2022, Molecule has raised $20+ million to further this goal.\n## About Nucleate\nNucleate is a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of biotech leaders. With chapters spanning 23 geographic regions and participation from over 120 academic institutions, Nucleate sparks new intellectual communities and embeds emerging talent within a global biotech community. Through open-access educational programming, Nucleate helps democratize biotech innovation — removing barriers and helping founders concentrate on building transformational technologies. \n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecule-announces-nucleate-partnership-100k-desci-award)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecule-announces-nucleate-partnership-100k-desci-award)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecule-announces-nucleate-partnership-100k-desci-award)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Naturally, this filled our minds, and became our inspiration for the [Ocean Data Economy Challenge](https://oceanprotocol.com/challenge/).\n> _Molecule Catalyst provides a platform for researchers working on novel therapeutics to raise funding from the public. Our mission is to democratise research funding and allow the public to engage with researchers while new discoveries are happening. — Titian Steiger,_[_https://link.medium.com/ZXbyNRYFo3_](https://link.medium.com/ZXbyNRYFo3)\n‍\nVisit the live application at <https://discover.molecule.to/> and see more details at <https://discover.molecule.to/>\nSee DevPost submission at <https://devpost.com/software/molecule-data-market>\nWe decided to create an integration between the [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/) and Molecule Catalyst, to enable DAO like management of research data produced from the projects funded via Molecule Catalyst, as well as monetize the research data to improve the value of the Molecule Catalyst markets for contributors.\nAs a real world example, for our first project on Catalyst, the University of Toronto Psychedelic Studies Research Program is running a large scale human study on micro-dosing psilocybin. During the study the lab will administer pharmaceutical-grade psilocybin in a lab environment. This study will produce preliminary insights and a dataset containing the actual results from patient experiments. These datasets could then inform further academic study. All data and materials will be made available to the public — and this is a real world use case today, that would benefit from Ocean’s system.\n![molecule-data-swap](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62472a1ca48922744e24335f_molecule-data-swap.png)\nWith Molecule Dataswap:\n  1. Researchers create campaigns to receive funding for their research milestones.\n  2. Contributors are rewarded for their support through a token distribution.\n  3. At each research phase, researchers are required to publish updates and data to prove their accomplishments and secure funding for that phase.\n  4. These datasets could then be published on the Ocean system, where interested parties can pay for access to them to help further fund the research.\n  5. All rewards from dataset consumption are sent to the bonded market and are fairly distributed to the original funding campaign contributors.\n\n\nWe realize that in these markets, there is a lot of value in the research data being produced, and to incentivize further funding of the project the contributors need to be directly invested in the production of good research data. With Molecule Dataswap, built on the Ocean Protocol, we can achieve that.\nCurrently, the Ocean Protocol has a static pricing system, and if data is the new oil, this needs to change. We believe we can greatly improve and build upon the Ocean Protocol feature set by introducing dynamic pricing and distributed ownership of datasets produced by Molecule Catalyst research projects.\nWe are already in discussions with a few research projects wanting to democratize ownership and access to their research data, while still fairly monetizing the data.\n‍\n‍\n## What is does\nMolecule Dataswap is a set of smart contracts and an oracle that allows data producers to fund the publication of a dataset, and offer access to the dataset at a dynamic price according to the state of the dataset’s bonded market. The dataset is essentially entered into and managed by a DAO, that fairly distributes Ocean token rewards to contributors in the form of dividends, and increases existing token holders’ token value.  \n\n## How we built it\n**Dynamic Pricing**\nCurrently, the Ocean Protocol has static dataset pricing. There are API endpoints for updating the asset metadata price via the Aquarius API. When introducing dynamic pricing, in our use case, the asset should be priced according to:\n  1. The funding status of the project generating the data\n  2. The popularity of the dataset\n\n\nThis is achieved by collecting the Ocean token rewards in a bonding curve collateral pool. A bonding curve is a function that defines the relationship between the token supply, underlying collateral (Ocean tokens), and the token price.\nWe used the token price to set the price of Ocean datasets. This means, the more contributors a research project has, the higher the value of the token. The more popular the Ocean dataset is, and the more it is consumed, the more the initial contributors benefit by being token holders.\nThe dynamic pricing scheme implemented in the hack is rather simple, but without further modelling (time for cadCAD!), does what it needs to in this context.\n### Smart Contracts\nWe forked the OpenRaise “Bonding Curves For DAOs” project as a good base for the bonding curve interface. We specifically needed to use an invariant preserving bonding curve implementation so that the token price function directly depends on the collateral deposited.\nThe contracts were refactored to allow depositing Ocean ERC20 tokens without directly calling the bonded market functions like “buy” and “sell”. This allowed us to set the bonded market as the Ocean Protocol beneficiary for dataset consumption.\nEvery time a dataset is consumed, the Ocean reward is sent to the bonded market, which increases the underlying collateral — this dynamically adjusts the bonded token price.\n### Oracle\nWhen the bonded token price changes, the oracle updates the Ocean token price of the relevant dataset via the Aquarias API and the dataset DDO metadata.\n### UI/UX\nWe designed our UI in Figma first, knowing that this was predominantly a contract and backend hack. You’ll see we implemented certain parts of the frontend and left others.\nThe consumer needs to be aware of the price they are paying for a particular dataset, as well as the price history. The price history gives the consumer an indication of the popularity of the dataset, and ideally quality too. The higher quality datasets should receive more funding and consumption, both of which contribute to the dataset price.\nWhen a publisher creates a dataset for consumption, they are given the option of which bonded market address they’d like to set as the beneficiary. The beneficiary is set and the DID ownership is transferred.\n  \n\n### Challenges we ran into\nWe ended up choosing a hack that delved quite deep into the Ocean stack, tested the limits of our understanding of the Ocean stack, as well as the capabilities of the Ocean stack.\nDuring the course of the Ocean challenge we opened 3 merge requests, and I think that’s part of the value of a hackathon, learning and contributing back to the supporting project.\n  1. <https://github.com/oceanprotocol/react-tutorial/issues/2>\n  2. <https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius/pull/226>\n  3. <https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-py/issues/421>\n\n\nThere were also challenges related to dataset ownership and permissions being transferred. In order to set the beneficiary, the ownership and associated permissions are also transferred. This made admin tasks like granting service agreement access difficult, and was a blocker for us wiring everything up. We realize there is probably a way to address this at a lower level, and will be discussing this with the Ocean team soon!\n### Accomplishments that we’re proud of\nWe touched on almost all parts of the Ocean stack, made our first contributions to the various Ocean Protocol repos, and became familiar with what will most likely be an important feature in the Molecule Protocol. This hack has a real world use case today, and once ready could easily be integrated into the Molecule stack.\n‍\n### **What we learned**\n  * The low level functionality of the Ocean Protocol\n  * The intricacies of the Bancor & [OpenRaise](https://github.com/dOrgTech/OpenRaise) bonding curve implementation\n  * What an integration between Ocean and Molecule could look like\n\n\n### What’s next for Molecule Dataswap\nIn future, we’d love to update the contracts to be multi-collateral — this would mean Ocean rewards could contribute value for research dataset consumption, and perhaps other protocols could slot in elsewhere.\nWith further help from the Ocean team, the different parts of our hack will surely find their way into the Molecule stack, and provide a useful feature of dynamic pricing for the Ocean Protocol.\n### Resources\n[Molecule Dataswap Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/molecule-data-market)\n[LIniumlabs Gitlab Repo](https://gitlab.com/linumlabs/ocean-challenge)\n[Open Raise](https://github.com/dOrgTech/OpenRaise)\n### Notes\n  1.

Pump.fun showed that when the barriers to creation fall, more good ideas rise, and new users are drawn into crypto. It was proof that culture eats strategy for breakfast.   \n‍\nWe are no strangers to bonding curves. Molecule’s founder was yapping about bonding curves funding science [back in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CsJ_nHnEMs). Molecule’s newest product, [Catalyst](http://catalyst.molecule.xyz), leverages a unique bonding curve for funding early-stage scientific research with IP tokens. But Catalyst is on Ethereum (Base).

This disconnect results in detrimental diseases being underfunded despite their impact on public health. For instance, conditions like longevity, hair loss, women’s health, cryonics, and brain aging often receive disproportionately less funding compared to their prevalence and burden on society.\nPublic funds play a substantial role in financing research. In Europe, approximately 0.74% of GDP is allocated to research and development (R&D), representing a significant public investment. In the United States, the investment is even higher, with R&D expenditures accounting for around 3.4% of GDP. Despite this forced, substantial investment by taxpayers, the public has almost no influence over how these funds are allocated.\nEnter Catalyst. By utilizing blockchains, Catalyst democratizes research funding, allowing individuals to directly support projects that resonate with them. This decentralized model aims to rectify the inefficiencies of the current research funding apparatus, ensuring that funding better aligns with societal needs. \nCatalyst empowers individuals to use their cryptocurrency to make impactful decisions, fostering a more transparent and impactful research funding protocol.\n‍\n## Introducing Catalyst: Aligning Incentives Through Onchain Intellectual Property\nMolecule is thrilled to unveil Catalyst, the decentralized science (DeSci) funding machine. Catalyst aims to fuel scientific advancements by enabling democratized research funding through tokenizing intellectual property (IP). \nCatalyst forms communities around the drug development process and empowers individuals to support meaningful scientific research. In exchange for funding the research, funders receive tokens with rights to the research IP. This creates aligned incentives for researchers and funders to collaborate to bring more breakthroughs to those in need. \n‍\n### Benefits of Catalyst\n#### For Funders:\n  * **Purchase Tokens to Fund Research** : Funders can contribute directly to advancing scientific research ideas. \n  * **Take Part in Research and Licensing Decisions** : In exchange for funding contributions, funders receive IP tokens, which gives them the right to participate in certain research and IP licensing decisions. \n  * **Trade Tokens to Match Evolving Interests** : Funders can trade their IP tokens on decentralized exchanges, giving them the flexibility to match their evolving interests.\n\n\n‍\n#### For Researchers: \n  * **Access to a Network of Global Funders:** Catalyst opens up new avenues for funding beyond traditional sources.\n  * **Build Community Around Your Research:** IP Tokens are tools for building engaged communities around research, so researchers can connect with passionate supporters and collaborators. \n  * **Focus on Science:** Researchers can concentrate on pursuing and advancing scientific work.\n\n\n‍\n### How Catalyst Works\nCatalyst works by turning scientific ideas into digital tokens (IP Tokens). IP Tokens allow researchers to grant funders rights in exchange for backing their project. These rights create a shared incentive for researchers and funders to collaborate together to make the research valuable. \nBut what rights do these IP Token holders have? The right to govern and access IP is limited by the IP-NFT holder. The governance decisions could include: \n  * Voting on proposed IP licenses\n  * Deciding on the distribution of proceeds earned from the IP-NFT and its IP\n  * Signaling support for experimental and clinical trial designs \n\n\nUsing IP Tokens and shared governance rights, Catalyst aligns the interests of researchers and funders, making it easier for them to collaborate around budding research ideas. \n‍\n### The Foundational Pieces of Catalyst\nCatalyst brings together key infrastructure to tackle the scalability and incentive challenges traditional research funding models face. These components include:\n**Democratized Funding:** Catalyst creates access to funding opportunities without the need for traditional intermediaries, enabling anyone to participate in funding research projects.\n**IP Tokenization:** Catalyst converts research funding into IP Tokens. IP Tokens grant the token holder rights to exclusive data, voting on project execution details, licensing the intellectual property to patients and pharmaceutical organizations, and determining how proceeds earned from licensing are distributed to token holders. \n**Bonding Curves:** Bonding curves distribute IP tokens, rewarding early funders with a larger share of tokens. Funders can contribute or withdraw funds until a project meets its funding goal, making funding science unruggable. \n‍**Liquidity Provision** : A portion of IPTs is used to set up a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange, allowing funders to swap their tokens and enhancing flexibility.\n‍\n## A New Era of Incentive-Driven Research Funding\nBy leveraging blockchain technology and tokenized intellectual property, Catalyst creates a dynamic, democratized funding marketplace that brings together researchers and funders, accelerating scientific progress.

    "markdown": "![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/689afbb5a4cbed5cec487c8d_Impactful%20Contributions.jpeg)\nMolecule Protocol V2 presents a comprehensive reimagining of how scientific intellectual property can be tokenized, governed, and monetized as blockchain-based [Real World Assets](https://chain.link/education-hub/real-world-assets-rwas-explained) (RWAs).\nMolecule Protocol V2 builds on the [current (V1) system](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/intro-to-ip-nft) by integrating traditional corporate structures with crypto tokens, enhancing compliance, tax efficiency, and investor appeal while preserving the ethos of decentralization. \nV2 refines and merges the V1 structures (IP-NFTs for tokenizing IP (e.g., patents, data) and IPTs for collaboration) with traditional startups by putting IP-NFTs in corporations with equity available for qualified IPT contributors. That equity that controls the IP and project treasury, enhancing project accountability and upgrading the utility of the Molecule V1 Protocol to introduce a new DeSci asset class: IP RWAs.\n## **The Genesis of a New Scientific Economy**\nThe traditional scientific funding model is broken. With [NIH budget cuts](https://www.molecule.to/blog/nih-cuts-jeopardize-innovation-decentralized-science-is-the-cure), biotech market drawdowns and the \"[Valley of Death](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/54591)\" claiming countless promising research projects, the scientific community needs new pathways to financial sustainability. That's where Molecule comes in. Molecule is a fundamental reconstruction of how we think about scientific IP ownership and capital formation in the digital age.\nOur journey began with a simple yet profound realization: what if we could make IP as liquid and tradeable as any digital asset, while maintaining the legal enforceability and compliance frameworks that institutional partners require? This question has guided our development of Molecule since its inception and continues with Protocol V2, which introduces a hybrid token-and-equity framework that bridges the gap between DeFi innovation and traditional biotech investment.\n## **The Architecture of Scientific IP Liquidity**\n**IP-NFT V2: Composable by Design**\nAt the core of Protocol V2 lies our revolutionary IP RWA infrastructure, built with composability as its foundational principle. V2 enables developers and advanced science projects to tailor their use cases with unprecedented technical, legal, and financial flexibility with institution-grade asset creation.\n**The Token-to-Equity-to-RWA Revolution**\nProtocol V2 presents an innovative pathway mapping early stage crypto participation to blockchain-based, institution-grade, real-world assets. We're working on solving one of the most persistent challenges in crypto: how to provide real economic rights from project inception through to RWAs using the science project’s IP assets.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/689c7a7b86416c3ff259f80d_photo_2025-08-13_13-41-41.jpg)\n**Phase 1: Token Acquisition**  \nContributors purchase [IPT](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts)s (Intellectual Property Tokens), which could be through a non-profit organization established to support advanced scientific research (such as a BioDAO, [most of which are non-profits](https://www.molecule.to/blog/biodaos-are-community-owned-research-translation-engines-not-investment-daos)) or on the open market. \n**Phase 2: Citizen-Led Science**  \nToken holders can support the research by participating in the research for some projects and by locking their tokens to vote on the research direction and project milestones. \n**Phase 3: The Equity Bridge**  \nWhen a project matures to the stage where it incorporates, contributors who want equity in the project corporation can undergo KYC and other qualifications depending on the project. Once legally qualified, contributors may obtain equity through project engagement. Institutional contributors, such as traditional biotech and venture capital firms, may also obtain project equity through capital contributions. \n**Phase 4: Revenue Distribution**  \nProtocol V2 introduces sophisticated mechanisms for revenue-sharing. When projects begin generating revenue through licensing or product sales, they can tokenize those revenue streams, begin automated buyback-and-burn of their IPTs, or both. If projects ever sell their IP, e.g. to a biotech company or venture capital firm, they can compliantly distribute sales revenues to their equity holders. \nThis innovation allows us to provide economic benefits to both active contributors and passive investors. The revenue flows through separate, compliant instruments that can be distributed or sold according to the project’s governance decisions.\n## **The Anatomy of Molecule Protocol V2**\nEach project operates through a carefully designed structure:\n  1. **Project Corporation** : Owns the IP-NFT and all associated intellectual property, providing familiar legal structures for institutional partners.\n  2. **Non-Profit Issuer** : A tax qualified organization that could issue IP tokens to contributors and investors.\n  3. **IP-NFT Smart Contracts** : Automate governance, treasury management, and revenue distribution according to predetermined rules.\n  4. **On-Chain Treasury Governance** : Each project maintains its own programmable treasury, governed by token holders through milestone-based disbursements. This creates accountability mechanisms where community members control funding release based on research progress, introducing unprecedented transparency to biotech R&D funding.\n\n\n## **Market Context: DeSci's Explosive Growth**\nThe timing for Protocol V2 couldn't be better. The DeSci ecosystem has reached a critical inflection point:\n  * **Market Capitalization** : The DeSci sector has grown to $1 billion in total market cap\n  * **Daily Volume** : Over $250 million in daily trading volume across ~30 active tokens\n  * **Institutional Interest** : Major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance are launching DeSci tokens, with BIO Protocol leading the charge\n  * **Ecosystem Funding** : Molecule's ecosystem has facilitated over $15 million in research funding across 35+ projects\n\n\nThis growth reflects growing recognition that traditional scientific funding models are inadequate for the pace of modern innovation. As NIH cuts threaten to reduce biomedical research funding by billions of dollars, DeSci offers a viable alternative that can mobilize global capital toward breakthrough research.\n## **A New Social Contract for Science**\nAt its essence, Protocol V2 represents a new social contract for scientific research—one where patients, researchers, funders, and communities share both risks and rewards in the pursuit of breakthrough therapies. By tokenizing science while maintaining legal compliance, we're creating markets for scientific innovation that can mobilize global capital toward humanity's greatest challenges.\nThe traditional \"publish or perish\" academic model has failed to adequately incentivize translational research. Our Protocol V2 framework creates sustainable business models for academic researchers while ensuring that successful therapeutics benefit all stakeholders, including the patients who need them most.\n## **Implementation and Next Steps**\nProtocol V2 is currently in closed beta, with selected BioDAOs and research teams testing our infrastructure. For researchers, funders, and developers interested in participating in this next phase of DeSci evolution, we encourage you to join our community [and reach out](https://webforms.pipedrive.com/f/clNlOczBDZM1pCQ4V8L0OcBIx64t0rm3d5SPlKxV3dzAPZW01za0YV6TXMTOm9dWld).\n## **Conclusion: The Scientific Singularity Approaches**\nWe believe we're approaching what we call the \"Scientific Singularity\"—a point where the combination of AI, blockchain, and decentralized funding mechanisms accelerates scientific discovery beyond current imagination. Protocol V2 is our contribution to this future: a legal, technical, and economic framework that makes scientific IP as liquid and programmable as any digital asset.\nThe challenges facing humanity, from aging and disease to climate change and resource scarcity, require unprecedented levels of collaboration and innovation. By tokenizing IP and creating markets for scientific advancement, we're building the infrastructure for a future where breakthrough discoveries can be funded by anyone, owned by communities, and deployed for maximum global benefit.\nThe future of science is decentralized, composable, transparent, and community-owned. Protocol V2 is how we get there.\n_To learn more about Molecule Protocol V2, or join our developer community, visit_[ _molecule.xyz_](http://molecule.xyz/) _or connect with us on_[ _Discord_](https://discord.gg/9rfBMcH8VA) _or_[ _Telegram_](http://t.me/moleculexyz/1) _.

Transactions involving biopharma IP always differentiate between the specific rights and relating terms of the purchase. Therefore, it is common to use license agreements to structure the terms surrounding the IP. Terms may include _exclusivity, applicable territory, relating IP, grants of rights, financials and much more_. This is relevant for the technical implementation of the IPNFT transactions as no biopharma IP will ever be sold without negotiating and determining the terms relating to the transaction.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/624706e29aa59fff0a3de833_1_S56U-IV3Dm3S75gj8sF7ow.png)\nEvery pharma deal ever - and btw: I made this\n‍\n## Important consideration when designing an IPNFT infrastructure\nSeveral aspects need to be considered when designing and implementing an IPNFT infrastructure. As they vary depending on the IP, we will be highlighting biopharma specific aspects:\n**a) Privacy**\nMany early-stage biopharma assets have not filed for patent applications. No protection of the IP under patent law may therefore exist. The envisioned IPNFT infrastructure must account for the privacy needs of the transacting parties. Before and after the transaction, access to the IP and relating license agreements need to be managed by the parties. Potential adversaries should not be able to retrieve any information while the owner of the IP may grant access to a certain transacting party.\n**b) Accessibility & Verifiability**\nTo be able to implement a liquid market around IPNFTs some relevant information needs to be accessible and verifiable by the public. This includes transaction metadata such as transaction dates, ownership, price, etc.\n**c) Permanence**\nLastly, transaction history and metadata information need to be permanently available to market participants. This creates reliability and transparency for different parties to make decisions concerning their future market participation.\n## Infrastructure of the IPNFT\nTo bring biopharma IPNFTs into reality, several components will be needed. The ownership of the unique asset needs to be implemented via a distributed ledger technology (DLT) such as Ethereum. In addition, data concerning the transaction and its content needs to be stored on separate components. The metadata of the assets and transactions needs to be permanently and publicly accessible. Information relating to the IP needs to be securely stored while preserving the privacy of the owner. Molecule decided to implement a variation of [Nevermined’s](https://www.nevermined.io/) gateway infrastructure to solve the stated challenges. A detailed breakdown of Nevermined components can be found on their [Medium](https://medium.com/nevermined-io/introducing-nevermined-92ce2bf31d27) and [Github](https://github.com/nevermined-io/).\n![ip nft infrastructure molecule dao](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/624707896e294157c8e96e48_ip-nft-infrastructure.png)\nOverview of the Molecule’s IPNFT infrastructure\n### a) Distributed Ledger Technology: Ethereum\nWith Ethereum being the current standard for storing ownership information via NFTs, we opted for using it for the biopharma IPNFT as well. Ethereum provides two token standards to implement ownership of non-fungible assets: [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155). With most smart contract wallets having implemented the ERC721 Receiver, the first version of the IPNFT opts for using ERC721.\n‍\n![metadata json ip nft molecule](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/624707e5d5e6016c8110b4ed_metadata-json-ip-nft-molecule.png)\nOverview of Metadata JSON connected to an NFT (source: OpenSeas ”NFT Bible”)\n### b) Metadata storage layer\nWith the smart contracts only being able to store a very limited amount of data, the need for further data storage off-chain arises. One category of relevant data is the NFT metadata. It adds publicly available information to the NFT and enables the storage of further links to privately secured information. The goal is to make the metadata permanently available, ensuring the ERC721 information remains accessible to the market. To achieve this, Molecule chose to use [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). Arweave is a permanent distributed storage layer. Its economic model enables a one-time payment for permanent storage of an asset. This is perfect for the long-lived nature of biopharma IP.\n### c) Data-storage Layer\nThe second category of data to be handled is the IP and license agreement themselves. In the best case, those agreements could be stored on a permanent decentralized data storage layer, as well. However, existing decentralized storage layers do not have restrictive access management tools incorporated yet. While to-be-developed services might enable this in the future, Molecule opted for an immediately usable solution via [Nevermined.](https://www.nevermined.io/) With Nevermined, the IP will be stored in centralized data storage of the parties, while the access management is handled via the implemented NFT. The hosting party only needs to integrate the Nevermined Gateway, enabling external parties to access the data via the purchased NFT.\n## First Implementation - the IP-NFT POC\n![ip nft licence agreement molecule dao](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62470b571a3f09907693830a_ip-nft-licence-agreement-molecule-dao.png)\nExample of a license agreement\nTo showcase the usability of the stated infrastructure, Molecule is creating the first proof of concept (POC) for the biopharma IPNFT. Molecule has set up a license agreement for the [“Longevity Molecule”](https://discover.molecule.to/project-details/the-longevity-molecule-1603031933959x305091127349719700) with the [Scheibye-Knudsen Lab](https://scheibye-knudsen.com/) of the [University of Copenhagen.](https://www.ku.dk/english/) The newly formed longevity research organization called VitaDAO has communicated their interest in purchasing the IP via a sub-license agreement. The agreement (as a legal document) is created and will be cryptographically signed via a transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain. A record of the transaction will be added to the sub-license agreement in form of a cryptographic hash. After the signing process is completed, an NFT is being created and the signed document is added to the metadata JSON of the IPNFT.\nAfter the agreed purchasing amount for the sub-license is being transferred to the license holder Ethereum Address, the NFT is being transferred to the buying party. VitaDAO now holds the NFT and, therefore, permanent access to the IP and licensing agreement.\n### Outlook\nAfter the POC has proven the IPNFT is a feasible and efficient way of transacting biopharma IP, the challenge of implementing it in a scalable manner will arise. Several tools for creating standardized legal agreements to be signed via a blockchain transaction have been envisioned and developed in the past. Since 2017 there have been two approaches of note to attaching legal contracts to smart contracts. The most prominent and relevant is OpenLaw, which developed a sophisticated system and proprietary markup language for legal agreements that can be executed via smart contract transactions. The other is ZeroLaw’s [Code Deference Agreement](https://github.com/lex-node/SCoDA-Simple-Code-Deference-Agreement-/blob/master/DAO%20Charter%20with%20Qualified%20Code%20Deference.md) developed for DAOs looking to function as unincorporated associations and empowering them to make binding governance decisions via smart contracts.\nBy integrating such systems, legal agreements for IPNFT can be standardized and modularized, enabling any party to propose a license agreement. Once the license agreement is created and agreed upon the above-described infrastructure will enable to sign an agreement, create and transact any IPNFT.**‍**\n**Acknowledgement**\nThank you for helping on this piece Paul, Tyler, Stefano, Heinrich, Beata & Jesse!  \n\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecules-biopharma-ip-nfts-a-technical-description)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecules-biopharma-ip-nfts-a-technical-description)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecules-biopharma-ip-nfts-a-technical-description)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Watch the transfer ceremony with Dr. An below or [here](https://youtu.be/JgwC2prEtSM?t=67):\nDr. An’s research interests lie at the intersection of Geroscience (aging biology) and Oral Biology. His primary research focuses on understanding the basic biological mechanisms of aging in the context of oral health and disease. Chronic, subclinical dental inflammation may be a driver of systemic inflammation and especially cardiovascular disease risk, due to the lymphatic connections between the heart and mouth. This field is largely neglected by the pharmaceutical industry. \nAs a practicing dentist, Dr. An experiences a lack of mechanistic understanding of why older people are more susceptible to oral disease and oral health decline on a daily basis. Dr. An’s laboratory targets specific hallmarks of aging in the oral cavity to translate these discoveries into the clinic. Dr. An is currently an Assistant Professor of Oral Health Sciences and Faculty in the Healthy Aging and Longevity Institute. He also serves as the Assistant Graduate Program Director of Oral Health Sciences. Dr. An currently directs courses in the departments of Oral Health Sciences and the Department of Lab Medicine and Pathology.\nPeriodontal disease (periodontitis) is a worldwide burden that affects over 70% of older adults. It reduces oral health-related quality of life, impacts systemic health, and an often-neglected age-related disease for which there is no cure. Consequently, the research of Jonathan An’s laboratory at the University of Washington focuses on the intersection between biological mechanisms of aging and the accompanied onset of common age-related oral health conditions, with a special emphasis on periodontitis. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62e97387410be0b5841bf89c_Dr.%20Jonathan%20An%20IP-NFT%20Oral%20Health.gif)\nThe IP-NFT Artwork by [UltraRare](https://www.ultrarare.bio/)\nA major neglect in all current standard therapy and research of periodontitis is the impact of a low-grade, chronic inflammation without overt infection known as “inflammaging”. By evaluating pathways that target “inflammaging”, Jonathan An’s team recently demonstrated that modulating the PI3K/NFkB/mTOR cellular signalling axis with an immunosuppressive and antiproliferative mTOR inhibitor rejuvenated oral health and reversed periodontal disease in an age-related periodontitis animal model. In the project funded here, An’s research group plans to ultimately translate an additional set of drug candidates with already well defined characteristics and a proven effect to interfere with the inflammatory response triggered by the PI3K/NFkB/mTOR into the first medical, non-surgical treatment for age-related periodontitis.\n> _“Current therapies are limited to treating the symptoms and fail to address the underlying cellular and molecular causes of oral disease and decline in older adults, which we hypothesize are a direct consequence of biological aging. Targeting such processes may introduce novel strategies to prevent the onset, the progression, or even reverse age-related oral decline and disease ”_ - Jonathan An\nYou can learn more about the research proposal on [Molecule’s project page](https://discover.molecule.to/projects/cl3wwla36036009mq8qs6b7mk) or on the [VitaDAO governance site](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-18-jonathan-an-towards-reversing-periodontal-disease-using-geroscience/470). \nTo learn more, discuss or try this approach, connect with us at info@molecule.to or join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uAGW7K4hQU) to interact directly with our team.

    "markdown": "![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62aa25c82895ec6b0d507a78_evandro-fang.jpg)\nThe [Fang Laboratory](https://evandrofanglab.com/) is working on the molecular mechanisms of ageing and the age-predisposed Alzheimer’s disease. Evandro Fang is a leader in the field of defective mitophagy as a key driver in Alzheimer's disease initiation and progression and he has published over 70 papers in international peer-reviewed journals including papers in Cell, Cell Metabolism, Nature Reviews MCB, and Nature Neuroscience.\nMitophagy is a central cellular process that enables our body to remove dysfunctional mitochondria. This process is impaired in the elderly, leading to the accumulation of damaged cellular organelles called mitochondria. The homoeostatic maintenance of functional mitochondria, which operate as cellular “powerhouses”, plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity and memory and thus the disturbed removal of dysfunctional mitochondria can adversely affect neuronal function and trigger neurodegeneration.\nFor this project, Fang and his team aim to use their in-house artificial intelligence and wet lab validation platform to identify and characterize new drug candidates for activation of mitophagy with a positive impact on Alzheimer's disease. Fang’s work to identify new ways to rescue diminished mitophagy holds promise to combat the onset of various age related neurodegenerative diseases - research that is now enabled through Molecule’s IP-NFT.\n> _“I am extremely grateful for the funding from as well as the collaboration with Molecule/VitaDAO community. This funding will enable us to further modify the known mitophagy inducers we identified and to identify new mitophagy inducers, with a final aim to develop drug candidates for healthy ageing and to treat Alzheimer’s disease.” -_ Evandro Fang\n## Funding through the IP-NFT\nMolecule is building a comprehensive funding ecosystem for early-stage research discoveries. Apart from major key aspects within this ecosystem, both the IP-NFT itself and our marketplace (Molecule Discovery) is of particular importance. Here’s why:\n  1. With [Molecule Discovery](https://discover.molecule.to/), researchers can submit and curate their research projects in order to attract industry-specific funders (i.e Evandro Fang’s [submission](https://discover.molecule.to/projects/cl3vggwbj006409ms46la337n), which attracted attention and [funding from VitaDAO](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-21-discovery-of-novel-mitophagy-activators-w-evandro-fang/514)). In turn, funding is provided through Molecule’s IP-NFT framework, where intellectual property is attached to a non-fungible token and allows researchers to fundraise commercially (i.e, the funding of this project).\n  2. With the IP-NFT, researchers can fundraise commercially without needing to patent early or create a startup. Moreover, researchers can engage patients directly, collaborate with other researchers to promote open science, and collaborate on research tasks utilizing data access control and create new funding strategies that take advantage of data marketplaces.\n\n\nThus, Molecule acts as an enabler for researchers in two ways, 1) through the Discovery platform and 2) through the IP-NFT itself. This collaborative relationship within the ecosystem thus poses an alternative to traditional grant funding where the IP-NFT can be considered a better and more efficient alternative to acquire funding and, in general, to generate funding where needed.\nEssentially, such an alternative, now proven for the third time in biomedical research history, can advance drug development at universities, moving the biopharma industry as a whole one step closer to help its most important stakeholders - patients.\n## The characteristics of this IP-NFT\nAlthough in general composed of different aspects and facets, this IP-NFT has two distinctive traits: how the IP-NFT was acquired and the artwork. Acquiring the IP-NFT, VitaDAO took advantage of the new Molecule Exchange platform - our marketplace side where prospective investors can buy, sell or place bids on IP-NFTs. On the artwork, Dani from UltraRare Bio showcased the mitophagy pathway in an editorial looping animation, guiding you through this pathway by incorporating a camera technique called a ‘rack focus’, shifting focus between early and late stages of mitophagy. In the background, the illustration shows the early-stage formation of a double-membrane structure, the phagophore, encompassing a damaged mitochondrion. In the foreground, one of the final stages of mitophagy is shown: the point right as lysosomal fusion begins, resulting in degradation of the damaged, encompassed mitochondrion.\n_Molecule is eager to help researchers, labs, biotechs and universities around the world that wish to work this way — particularly, those daring enough to try new things and herald a new era of innovation._\n_To learn more, discuss or try this approach, connect with us at_ _info@molecule.to_ _or join our_[ _Discord_](https://discord.gg/moleculedao) _to interact directly with our team._\n_Watch the IP-NFT transfer ceremony with Evandro here:_\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62aa32d2042d42a93022b711_Screenshot%202022-06-15%20at%2021.26.58.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcUXGzgm8_k)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecules-ip-nft-is-now-facilitating-alzheimer-s-research-at-the-university-of-oslo)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecules-ip-nft-is-now-facilitating-alzheimer-s-research-at-the-university-of-oslo)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecules-ip-nft-is-now-facilitating-alzheimer-s-research-at-the-university-of-oslo)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

At the center of this crisis is a $4 billion freeze on National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding - a decision that risks undermining the very foundation of biomedical innovation.\nThis isn't just a line item on a federal budget. It’s a direct hit to early-stage research, and the impact on long-term drug development and the overall health infrastructure will be lasting and profound.\nOnce again, the need to build a **steadfast scientific funding infrastructure** has become evident. At Molecule, we’re not waiting for old systems to catch up. We’re building a system that empowers scientists with the agility, financial independence, and support they need to thrive in this new era of research.\nHave you been impacted by funding cuts? We’re helping researchers across the globe source funding for critical research. [Contact us today](https://webforms.pipedrive.com/f/6GWkK0JgRuJWUP2eTWQIMkDoKOGC405ZTyi2jyilD0xBUOXfss1XzdiBM9FxLUPPwv) to learn more. \n### Billions Lost, Thousands at Risk: The Real Cost of NIH Cuts\nWith an annual budget of approximately [$48 billion](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/budget#:~:text=Nearly%2083%20percent2%20of,research%20institutions%20in%20every%20state.), the NIH is responsible for funding up to 94% of all biomedical research in the U.S. This support is foundational. NIH-backed research has played a role in [99% of the drugs approved between 2010 and 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10148199/).\nBut in recent months, the NIH has faced swift and extreme funding cuts, leaving many researchers completely impeded. Those who have escaped the cuts live in uncertainty, unable to predict the new funding landscape they are faced with. Karlin Compton, a PhD candidate at Northwestern University shared; \"As a researcher in biology, our entire field benefits from NIH funding in some way. New government officials believe they’re changing research for the better, but instead they’re disrupting the groundbreaking work people are doing and causing irreparable damage to the synergistic relationship between governmental funding and research for the greater good that took decades to establish. Young graduate students, especially those like me from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds are feeling nothing but uncertainty and fear at how we are going to be able to not only perform research and publish our work, but also support ourselves and our families.\"  \n\nThe reductions include a dramatic cut in indirect cost reimbursement, from an average of 30% (with some institutions receiving up to 70%) to a flat 15%. This shift threatens to eliminate**~$5 billion** annually from the budgets of academic and research hospitals, undermining the operational capacity of these institutions.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6808c4102e25446ee9d35002_AD_4nXcrTwdwAdVTYhc7Z2D-j1whvIlrjLcHSJKmrozQducuE4OY9usFJQtbyQnVMcejmpNjCfgNS5GD8DItuv5v8LubMcgvVCSgwERs77_eljxBeP_EzvRh-0OfQHOYyKU8BlC3lSRtYQ.png)\n_View the_[ _interactive map._](https://scienceimpacts.org/)\nThese cancellations are already causing ripple effects, shutting down promising research, and pausing projects that address pressing public health challenges. Across social media and institutional forums, scientists are raising alarm: stalled grants, lost renewals, and disappearing career paths. The research community is facing a climate of fear and instability.\nUp to [5,000 NIH staff positions (25% of its workforce) are at risk](https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/14/nih-staff-cuts-reorganization-morale/#:~:text=Up%20to%205%2C000%20positions%20are,agency%2C%20as%20buyout%20deadline%20passes&text=With%20the%20National%20Institutes%20of,been%20confirmed%20by%20the%20Senate.), alongside thousands of jobs at universities and hospitals nationwide. The cost isn’t just financial. It’s human, and it’s happening now.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6808c410668a6de94555d482_AD_4nXdy-7fwHa20HjWoZk-wUTirE8_6H5RCPGWSlrtk0YiPtVGzA7lCH42XX2YRZaYTcWFxWn7T5H_DHxkEPla2pe6aY9sQuB3AMPLZdMgKiVQ3D1FqQYzfS7JDZUhPhtcZiK9Neae_xw.png)\n### The Ripple Effect of Budget Cuts\nNIH funding is not simply an expense; it’s an investment that yields considerable returns. [Data shows that](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/impact-nih-research/serving-society/direct-economic-contributions) every $1 invested in NIH funding generates $2.46 in economic activity. By slashing NIH funding, these economic returns are put in jeopardy; a $4 billion reduction could result in a $10 billion loss to the economy, affecting not only the scientific community but also the large industries that depend on biomedical research.\n### Finding Hope: How DeSci Offers Solutions in the Face of Funding Uncertainty\nScientists are feeling afraid. The world they woke up in has changed, and the reliability of these legacy institutions has been called into question. But, this is not all bad. Times of disruption can catalyze great change and the adoption of new systems.\nIt has long been clear that the traditional funding model is too slow and fragile for today’s pace of innovation. It's more important than ever to adopt models that prioritize scientific progress. With lay-offs and funding cuts threatening the progress of scientific research in the U.S., **decentralized science (DeSci)** is a critical balm addressing the challenges faced by the scientific community today.\nDeSci is a global movement that leverages technological advancements such as blockchain technology to make science accessible, equitable, and fast. It challenges the bottlenecks of legacy systems by unlocking new paths for funding, collaboration, and ownership in research.\nAt Molecule, we are building a system that gives scientists the agility and financial independence they need, ensuring they secure the support to continue their work in a community-driven science ecosystem.\n### A New Era for Science: Empowering Innovation Through DeSci\nDeSci has already quietly been reshaping scientific funding.\nTake [VITA-RNA](https://www.vitarna.xyz/) for example, which is focused on innovative RNA therapies, exemplifies what happens when scientists step outside the broken funding system. Supported by Molecule’s decentralized intellectual property (IP) protocol, [Dr Michael Torres](https://x.com/Mykalt45) and his team were able to secure the resources needed to advance their research. Their science accelerated because they weren't constantly fighting the system designed to support them.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6808c40fc67baaa5111028a5_AD_4nXfa8t334pw1sdJ0jAlZhfigMvdAQK3fc0tjeFgoPrGrwOEC9C8Jg3_xEdEuPIRcTGyBvSg6T4n1Hkb30InZVH1Tqcu113vzcCuUiZfRkBh3V2hlsPDkppTBSp5rU-PpkrggqXATvg.png)\nSimilarly, [Karda Forge](https://discord.com/channels/938351551314010163/1308380332831281172) raised $200K in 26 minutes - a far cry from the months that typical grant applications take. Today, critical research into biomining and e-waste is occurring because of support from the DeSci ecosystem. \nThese success stories signify a shift. There are viable alternative pathways for scientists facing today's unprecedented funding challenges.\n### Ready to Explore Alternatives?\nIf you're a researcher affected by these recent challenges, we're here to explore how alternative solutions might support your invaluable work. \n‍[We’d love to talk to you.](https://webforms.pipedrive.com/f/6GWkK0JgRuJWUP2eTWQIMkDoKOGC405ZTyi2jyilD0xBUOXfss1XzdiBM9FxLUPPwv)\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/nih-cuts-jeopardize-innovation-decentralized-science-is-the-cure)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/nih-cuts-jeopardize-innovation-decentralized-science-is-the-cure)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/nih-cuts-jeopardize-innovation-decentralized-science-is-the-cure)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

The research in Dr. Amit Sharma’s laboratory focuses on the effects of aging and underlying cellular mechanisms that dictate the functionality of our immune system. More particularly, his work at the SRF Research Center, as part of the broader ApoptoSENS project theme, aims to harness the immune system to mitigate deleterious effects of dysfunctional cells that accumulate with age.\n‍\n> _“The process of grant proposal review was unique in its nature of community involvement with individuals from different backgrounds asking relevant questions that further enriched the project and the scientific approach. The entire VitaDAO community was very enthusiastic and supportive of scientific development. The collaborations between traditional scientific community and IP-NFTs can serve as a viable alternative model for future biomedical research.” -_ Dr. Amit Sharma \n‍\n## The Research\nWith prolonged lifespan, more and more cells throughout our body experience various stress events that arrest them at a state of terminal growth in a process called cellular senescence. Cellular senescence contributes to complex effects on physiology and disease processes, either in a beneficial way (e.g. wound healing) or extensively detrimental as it triggers or exacerbates numerous age-related diseases. With increasing evidence that senescent cells adversely affect aging-associated declines and malfunctions, targeted strategies have been explored to selectively destroy senescent cells to onset rejuvenating benefits and ameliorate or reverse multiple diseases of aging. Senescent cells differ greatly from healthy cells in the patterns of several cell surface markers that can serve as markers and therapeutic targets. \nDr. Sharma’s team previously set out to identify such cell surface markers uniquely present in senescent cells and successfully identified 3 promising candidates that serve as the basis for the project funded here. The validated surface markers will now be used to create designed natural killer cells, named CAR-NK cells, that specifically target senescent cells and allow their immune system-mediated clearance as a potential new form of therapeutic intervention.\n## The Importance of Connecting BiotechDAOs to the Real World \nIf R&D IP is siloed and owned by individual companies, these companies could have a very strong bias towards only publishing positive data and this leads to information asymmetry. In contrast, an open research community would achieve desired outcomes comparatively faster if research was done collaboratively with unbiased sharing of results. True scientific learning would be enabled and the myriads of duplication work through failed experiments also has the potential to reduce R&D costs on scale. Connecting BiotechDAOs to real world projects would be a key facilitator here.\nThe funding of Dr. Sharma’s research through Molecule’s IP-NFT framework is paramount in this respect - only the 5th occurrence in history where the transfer of IP ownership and medical research has been achieved through an NFT. Not only has pharma IP been transacted on the blockchain, but the IP rights have been moved into custodianship of VitaDAO, a BiotechDAO enabling and fostering promising translational research in longevity science. \n## ‍**The illustration for VitaDAO’s NFT  \n**\nThe illustration for VDP-38 (the governance proposal on [VitaDAO’s discourse forum](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-38-apoptosens-senolytic-car-nk-cells/572/)) uses a metaphor to highlight CAR-NK cells' ability to accurately target senescent cells. Target specificity is represented here as the beam angle being emitted by each therapy. In traditional senolytic approaches, therapies have a large \"beam angle\" that sheds light on both healthy and senescent cells; i.e., they are non-specific. On the other hand and in the foreground, CAR-NK cells have a narrow \"beam angle\" that sheds light only on the senescent cells in the cell landscape, while leaving the healthy tissue unrevealed. The style of this artwork was inspired by retro travel posters, and the composition leverages diagonal, parallel lines and rule of thirds to create a strong focus on CAR-NK specificity.  \n  \n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6346d3161528ca1a7d427a45_vP18Gsb6bmyjrxpJJ3sbIIW6SSMs880iDJP6qFL5h3REZGdFyoJVdRIcSztCZV1BXja8IElTlr1_fHhpVUaATx4sBvXTTUM0Elqdj8aA-gErjohHj9W5GwL16q8Wbf82VArOFD1sVZC4vZIiWeo6_rvHWwXIqVVOGOGEZXH8URTZ4vy79HGmWgqe.jpeg)\n‍\n## Funding through the IP-NFT owned by BiotechDAOs\nMolecule is creating a holistic funding system for early-stage research projects, with the IP-NFT and our marketplace (Molecule Discovery) both being crucial components of this ecosystem. With the IP-NFT, researchers can submit and curate their research projects with Molecule Discovery in order to attract industry-specific funders. In turn, funding is provided through Molecule’s IP-NFT framework, where, as mentioned, intellectual property is attached to a non-fungible token (an NFT).

Now we’re giving that science a home.\nIntroducing **Molecule Labs** - a new interface designed specifically for the researchers and project leads behind tokenized IP. It’s a data hub, a communication layer, and a project management tool, purpose-built for the onchain research era.\nWith Molecule Labs, project teams finally have a single place to publish updates, manage files, and build a public track record of their work. \nBut here’s what makes it powerful: **everything pipes directly into the Molecule platform**. That means token holders - and anyone else - can track real-time research progress right from the existing IP token pages on[ molecule.xyz](https://molecule.xyz).\nOne interface for project teams.  \nOne interface for the public.  \nA connected view of onchain science.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/68473af2415997ac24f03773_AD_4nXfZv-u9_lxuWP73QaLdtdPDWiN1bKrJ1x0yELcrFnZObGCkUOdoIekI1NmABlQu7DqTx_P7AtmzHKypt2Ai6eCfEwZvGvDD9lWdhuLXbYYQ2-u4SxI8LB96_G0MEHhDlpqxCbwyhA.png)\n_Project Lead view of Molecule Labs_\n## What Is Molecule Labs?\nThink of it as the GitHub for decentralized science.\nIt gives research leads a control panel to:\n  * Upload files and updates (pitch decks, results, datasets, milestones, lab pics, conference presentations, and more)\n  * Create structured progress timelines that live on beyond Snapshot proposals or Discord threads\n  * Link project updates to their Telegram groups & send real-time updates to their IPT community \n  * Manage all their data using decentralized storage\n  * And coming soon: token-gated updates and completely confidential encrypted updates, so they can choose what to share publicly, and what to share with their token community\n\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/68473af2415997ac24f03770_AD_4nXe3fP_fluO5b3Ja-7UrnRQMF-uXL8c3zpZRwEckZJjoFcKbXnMjpJGIRqUyKcR51_AWpHtoeYFDzv3QQ_2xOKqttWmJlYkWY6AiwIy7cuq-i39HH_7ODA6LM-Alq5mKk92LPUz6mA.png)\n_Example of an update straight to the community_\n## How It Connects \nWhile Molecule Labs is built for project leads, it’s fully integrated into the existing Molecule platform. Every update, file, and data point can be surfaced directly on the corresponding token’s page.\nThis means:\n  * Token holders can view real-time updates without needing to ask or dig\n  * The public can explore science projects through actual progress, not just metadata\n  * Visibility increases - and with it, credibility\n\n\nWe’re taking the crypto ethos of “don’t trust, verify” and applying it to the scientific process.\n## Why It Matters\n**For project leads** , Molecule Labs provides structure, storage, and communication. It's a place to show your work, engage your community, and build a track record that can support future fundraising.\n**For token holders** , it brings clarity: which projects are building, which are shipping, and what the actual science looks like.\n**And for Molecule** , it brings together everything we’ve built, tokens, funding rails, discovery, and now real-time open data, into one connected ecosystem. We’re really excited.\n## Project updates are already live on Molecule.xyz\nMolecule Labs launched during the 4th edition of DeSci.Berlin and is now live for a whitelisted set of projects, including those from [CerebrumDAO](https://www.cerebrumdao.com/), [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/) and [ValleyDAO](https://www.valleydao.bio/). Navigate to the token pages to see what's new. \nAs more teams begin publishing updates through Molecule Labs, their token pages on molecule.xyz will begin to reflect their activity automatically.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/68483aba6cc372752c43902a_Screenshot%202025-06-10%20at%2016.00.34.png)\n## Explore Molecule Labs in Action\nIt’s time to view real-time updates for IP tokens!

He shares his experiences in biohacking, the pharma industry, the drug development process and how web3 could play a crucial role in making drug development more efficient, fair and transparent. This is achieved through BioDAOs an open source approach of pharmaceutical early stage research and leveraging the traits of NFTs through and a new standard, the IP-NFT.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6271a585e9cba47665089131_paul-kohlhaas-zima-red-ip-nft.jpg)\nMolecule is a company that is virtualizing and decentralizing how drug development works. They do this by attaching data and IP rights to non-fungible tokens (NFT's) and then bringing the core IP into web3. This makes the intellectual property liquid, which is very hard to achieve in biotech today, and also enables price discovery around IP. Molecule has created a curation market where people can trade and discover therapeutics for drugs. \nMolecule has also started building biotech DAOs, which are research collectives that are comprised of patients, investors, and researchers in a specific therapeutic area. The mission is to democratize access to medicine by empowering researchers and patients to become co-owners of the IP and data associated with a new therapeutic. \nPaul describes how the company's IP-NFTs work to store data associated with a new therapeutic and how they can be used to fractionalize ownership of the IP. He also walks through the company's roadmap and explains how they plan to decentralize ownership of the data and IP associated with a new therapeutic. Paul discusses the origins of VitaDAO and IP-NFT, the process of setting up a DAO, and the long-term vision for a DAO-based ecosystem for pharmaceutical research and development.The grand vision for the projects is to develop a drug that is enabled and discovered through the process and reaches patients in an eight to ten year timeframe. He also discusses the potential for IP-NFTs to be used to fractionalize the ownership of IP and allow patients to contribute funding to research.\"\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 0:00\n**_Hey what's up everyone, I'm Andrew Steinwold, and this is ZIMA RED.

This episode offers a sneak peek in the future of medicine, please enjoy my conversation with Paul. Paul, thank you so much for joining me today. Super excited to chat with you. And to get started, I'd love to hear a little about your background._**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 0:56 \nHi, Andrew. Yeah, thank you so much for the invite on the show. And hi to everyone who's listening. My name is Paul Koolhaas, I am the founder of a new protocol and DAO called Molecule. And my background is pretty atypical to be working on something that straddles the biotech space, but I've been working in the crypto space for a really long time. So when I was a teenager around 16,17,18, I spent a lot of time in online biohacking forums. And these are some of the forums that splintered off harm reduction sites like [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/). So Erowid, for example, was a large collection of trip reports on psychedelics run in the public domain, a lot was pioneered by Alexander Shulgin, who was the original inventor of MDMA, and then went on to work at a pharma company, as he was doing that, and the pharma company didn't think his work was valuable. I think organizations, such as [MAPS](https://maps.org/) are really proving that this thesis was completely wrong. But he went on to discover hundreds of different very strange novel psychedelic compounds, many of them are being actively researched in therapeutic use cases today. And so these communities I was a part of, we're exploring these compounds in a very open fashion. Back then, these were all like unscheduled substances, and research chemicals. And I found that really fascinating, this open source nature of drug discovery and drug development. And as I got deeper into those communities, I realized, hey, at the fringes here, there's diabetes communities, for example, that are developing their own open source insulin synthesis methods. And some of these communities then gave birth to the open insulin movement in the United States, which is now fighting to provide very cheap and affordable insulin made in clandestine labs across the US. Another cases were cancer patient communities, that said, “hey, guys, there's a drug here on the US market, I need to survive and treat my cancer, it costs 150k out of pocket. I make 30k a year, but I have an internet connection.” \nAnd interestingly those communities source the base chemicals from the same Chinese manufacturers that the psychedelic research folks got their base chemicals from, so you have these big, Chinese and South Korean chemical manufacturers that back then didn't really care what you asked them to produce, as long as it wasn't patented. And as long as it was not a scheduled substance, I found that really fascinating. The same time, I was looking at the macroeconomics of the US pharmaceutical system. So these are like the early days of the US opioid crisis. And it started becoming apparent to me that there's something fundamentally wrong here that on the one side, there's people online that are being driven to engage in in some cases, dangerous behaviour, for example self testing compounds on themselves, and often out of sheer necessity. And on the other side, you have a large pharmaceutical system that's fundamentally failing to deliver what I would say is patient centric healthcare to providing medicine that is affordable by the public. I went on and studied , and I came looking at this whole thing because people in my family were prescribed early ADHD medication and antidepressant and I just felt like it wasn't really serving them. Yeah. And so I went on and studied economics at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, which is a fantastic, really rigorous Business School.\nDuring my time there, I started trading biotech stocks. I had a couple of friends, we were exchanging stock tips and I found that fascinating. A biotech stock typically tends to trade just on the value of the asset. And it's the burn rate of the company as it's trying to develop this asset. And it's typically just a line downwards, pretty steady, that represents the burning of the company. And then you have positive data emerge, and it does a 5x or 10x in the day, where you have negative data emerge, and it does like minus 80, 90% in a day. And if you think about that, that's, a fundamental market inefficiency. As we're studying, I found that fascinating, looking at systemic inefficiencies and how capital markets behave. And then a friend of mine did an internship at a company called Bitcoin Suisse. Which at the time was the first Bitcoin brokerage in Europe. That was mid 2013. And then he started telling me about Bitcoin. I think, it happened many of us, we quickly fell down this rabbit hole. I taught myself how to code. Because I then got interested in open source software and the way that these various cryptocurrency Reddits, were sprawling, and you'd have someone fork the Bitcoin code and a new coin would appear. I still remember master coin and the white paper emerged. I'm also a big fan of Dogecoin, in the early days, just because I find it hilarious. And then I finished my studies in economics and moved to South Africa. Worked briefly in private equity there. And then during my time there, this is like, mid 2015, was already pretty neat, knee-deep in crypto. \nThen I started my first company called Linium Labs at the age of 23. We started building out early applications on Ethereum. And providing training. And then did a couple of projects for larger companies that were at the time able to pay for development services, or that were trying to understand what's going on in this decentralized space, I became good friends with someone called Simon de la Rouviere, who I would say is like the grandfather of bonding curves.\nSo I've also done a lot of writing about bonding curves over the years because they're fascinating mechanisms for curating assets and discovering information. And then briefly worked at Consensys, did a project with UNICEF in digital identity in Cape Town, and then started working at Consensys, this is early 2017. And yeah, at the tail end of working at Consensys, I was doing a lot of work on data at the stations, and trying to figure out how we could attach data to stations to digital identities, and then also going into data marketplaces. So and then we were looking at NFT's among other things. And then I had this aha-moment where I thought, “hey, what if instead of attaching a picture of a cat to an NFT, we would attach a composition of matter patent”. So like the fundamental IP that describes a new drug or a new therapeutic. Yeah, and that gave the inputs to what I'm building today. That's like, going back almost, yeah, four years.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 8:22 \n**_Wow. Okay. That is incredible. So we have biohacking psychedelics, open source, creation of medicine, you studied economics, you're trading biotech stocks, I can definitely see how all this is leading up to what you're working on today. It's really incredible. Going all the way back to when you're a teenager, how do you get interested in biohacking? And to clarify, is it like I am putting some sort of device in my arm or what exactly about biohacking were you so interested in?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 8:54 \nI was really interested in on the one side how nutraceuticals certain chemicals or psychedelics, for example, can just fundamentally alter your consciousness. So there's a huge supplement market on the one side, for example, it's very active in bodybuilding. So that's a form of biohacking. How do you hack your system to behave differently. Lots of bodybuilders use very various forms of biohacking to boost their metabolism. But then biohacking also obviously goes into using nutraceuticals that boosts brain function. Lots of people use Modafinil, which you could also consider biohacking. It's hacking your system to behave somewhat differently. There's also a lot of research around meditation, meditation could be considered a form of biohacking to gain more focus to gain more clarity. Another community that I found fascinating was HIV communities that were developing their own gene therapies to overcome the disease that they had. Gene therapies are another form of biohacking. So it's not the cyborg sense like implanting something in someone, but that could be that could be considered biohacking as well. It's how do you hack your own biology through the means of substances through the means of how you change your behaviour.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 10:39 \n**_Incredible. You also mentioned that there's this movement of open source, medicine creation, I don't even know what you call that. But that's fascinating. Is that because the US healthcare system is just so fucked up?_**\n‍\nPaul Kolhaas 10:59 \nI think in many cases there is a movement. This was really inspiring to me and to our team. In the early days when we built Molecule, called the open source pharma and the open source pharma foundation. And so there are many areas of medicine that are just not of interest to pharma companies. Often, these can be rare diseases, where the patient populations are just too small. And pharma companies are not interested in bringing a drug to market. And then, the FDA gives special special approval methods to those disease areas, you have the orphan drug designation, for example. But even despite that, it's an uphill battle to get a drug approved, you need enormous amounts of capital to bring a drug to market. And in other areas, for example, in tropical diseases like malaria, that affects millions, hundreds of millions of people across the world, even, I think COVID may have changed this. But before COVID, I think malaria was one of those diseases that killed most people around the planet. Yet, we still since the 80s, 90s, it was not possible to develop an effective vaccine, or really, effective long term treatments for malaria. So this open source pharma foundation, consists of researchers around the world that banded together around various universities, I think it's UCL, for example, brace Australian universities, where researchers committing new drug targets, to an open source repo which you can find on GitHub. They use GitHub to do this open source malaria. It's also open source mycetoma, another tropical disease. And what's fascinating there, this type of work has been funded by organizations like the Gates Foundation, or, other international organizations that feel its humanitarian work in a way. But those organizations often just lack the funding to then bring a drug to market in the end. And they often just get stuck in the best case. So as soon as , these researchers upload drug targets, new discoveries that they have of what could be a potential treatment to this GitHub repo. And then they discuss it in a open source way. And that's a completely different way of how biotech companies work or the pharmaceutical system works. Because as soon as they make one of these GitHub commits, that drug target, (which might could be used to treat to cure malaria) gets unpatentable. Because now you have prior art. As soon as you have prior art, you're not able to file a patent application. And, it is really powerful if you think about it, because now no one will be ever able to patent that. But because no one can claim a patent, you're unable to bring this Molecule in the long pharmaceutical development pipeline. Even organizations like the Gates Foundation will not fund your work any more. The only the potential for this drug is to become a generic, no one can patent it. The problem with having a drug immediately as a generic and this is the same for these psychedelic compounds. Many of the psychedelic compounds, that could be used for example to treat depression, become technically unpatentable for that indication, once they are uploaded to GitHub. The problem now is that nobody (maybe in the future this will change) now pays for the clinical trials to bring it to market, because there is no way to recoup the high costs. And the cost for a third stage clinical trial can be, depending on the indication, in the hundreds of millions. And if the drug can only be a generic, you're never going to find a partner like a pharmaceutical company, that will help you shoulder the costs, even if it's paid with public funding to bring it to market. This was a huge insight. These researchers, in open source malaria, are not able to get funding for any of the drugs that they develop. Another example, if you are a researcher at a university, and you publish a blog post about a new molecule that you believe could cure cancer, that you just discovered, will never make it to market, because you can't patent it any more. We could have amazing cures out there, that would work. But due to the way that innovation works, in terms of protecting patents, and then shouldering the high costs to get to an FDA approval, you'll never be able to recoup those costs.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 16:21 \n**_Wow, okay, so you said that, that these people are uploading this research to GitHub, and I'm a complete noob here, but does this research look like code? Or is it like actual written papers that go into depth on more like theory? Or how does it look?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 16:37 \nIt can be both. I mean, it could be in most cases, it would just be a data set that describes a new molecule.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 16:49 \n**_Okay, why is pharma research so expensive?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 16:55\nThat's, that's a good question. So at Molecule we believe it could be way cheaper, if it was coordinated in a better way. The innovation processes, and the way that research is done in pharma, and specifically, the approval process, is extremely bureaucratic. And this has not really evolved in the past 30, 40, 50 years, the way that the FDA approves a drug today, and the hoops that companies need to jump through, haven't really evolved, despite so much new technology available. I think there's this cultural and bureaucratic problem. But because of that, I think many pharma companies have barely evolved. And I think can be compared to the banking industry. I think the banking industry is only started evolving in the past 10 years in the wake of FinTech, because Fintech is starting to really hurt their bottom line and take away customers and hurt their margins. I think we haven't seen any similar developments in the pharma space. If you think about it, it's beneficial for them, that it's really expensive to bring a drug to market, because it means that they're the only ones that can bring drugs to market. It's chronically hard, many biotech companies will never have an intention of bringing a drug to market themselves. Because they know, at the end of the day, they won't be able to shoulder those high-end stage costs. So what typically happens is that you, you have a biotech company, that spins out of a university, and then goes through several financing rounds, until the VCs that are financing that biotech company, their LPs or pharma companies themselves sell it to big pharma. The typical path is to become an acquisition target for a larger pharma company, that can gets the assets from that biotech company and brings them to market. Or what often also happens is that these companies IPO in order to be able to raise enough continuous capital, many of them that IPO typically don't make it to market , or they end up selling one of their lead assets. And, and many of them become zombie companies that keep existing despite not having a clear path of when one of their drugs could come to market.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 19:16 \n**_Okay, so let's pretend that the regulatory agencies that are approving these medicines of the pharmaceuticals, let's pretend that that process is super simple and super cheap. Is that cost then brought down by like 90% or 95% , and what is the main cost of researching pharmaceutical stuff? Is that that just labour costs for people testing all that stuff out?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 19:44 \nYeah, I mean, so you can differentiate between the preclinical stages and then clinical stage drug development. In the preclinical stages, costs have come down tremendously, because increasingly you can do a lot of outsourcing. And for example, if you have a certain compound today as you can choose from probably hundreds of providers today that can run standardized preclinical trials for you. These could be toxicology, reports, essays, fly studies, mouse studies, to determine whether it's even toxic and mammals in the first place, you tested in human cell cultures. And then you use all of that data to obtain an approval, like you do an IND application to obtain an approval to move into clinical trials. And in clinical trials, you're going to be testing the component in humans. And that gets much, much more expensive. But interestingly, if we compare this with these open source communities that I described earlier, you have an open source community that would try to obtain a certain compound. Now, typically, for example, these aren't cancer therapeutics. So it's a very different ballpark. But if you are testing a drug for chronically depression, and you hear about a new substance online, and you would obtain it, and it would help you, and that drug may have never gone through the typical preclinical costs and approval and application process. It is very expensive for a drug already to get into the first stages of clinical trials, where you test the drug then in the small patient population. But like, I think, for example, drug costs could be brought down exponentially if there was a more open source and anecdotal culture of how drugs are tested in certain indications. But okay, back to your question. So there's the preclinical cost, those have come down a lot, because we can increasingly do outsourcing. And outsourcing just means that and for example, we work with a company called [Arcturus](https://www.arctoris.com/), they receive, robotics laboratory. So they have robots that run an automated lab that will test your compounds. So you can just tell them, hey, I want to test the following compounds, please run the following experiments, they will get it synthesized for you, they will then test it in their lab, and they will upload the data to the cloud, or in our case, they would upload the data to an IP-NFT. And because there's a lot of outsourcing happening, the costs around this have become increasingly competitive. So 10, 20 years ago, it didn't make sense to start a biotech company with, less five, that's less than five to $10 million in funding, just because you had to build your own lab, you had to get all of this stuff yourself. Increasingly, you can do a lot of outsourcing. It's still more difficult, though, in the clinical trials process, where you can't really cut costs that easily. I think what we can do, enable a lot more coordination. And the other thing is the enablement of decentralized clinical trials. So typically, when you do a clinical trial, it's very expensive to find patients to run the trial with, then coordinate the patients, monitor the effects and all of that, and just the regulation around that is very strange. But one solution to that could be, this is a huge hope and actively being worked on: having more decentralized clinical trials. And then a last component of the high cost is really each player in the current pharmaceutical system, you have to imagine these assets get passed on from company to company. And if a biotech company goes through an acquisition, and an asset could go through multiple acquisition cycles, leaves a seed stage startup and goes into a b series funded startup. And then that b series funded startup eventually sells it on to like a larger pharma company, each transaction in that value chain, the people that transact in it, and these typically tend to be like, just financial transactions add costs because everyone is trying to make money with it, right? If I bought it for this much, I want to sell it at least for like 5x to make a 3x return, we invested like 2x of the cost, and so on and so forth. And in the end, the pharma companies still need to make a lot of money with it. And maybe then the last thing to say: all of these financial transactions add a lot of costs. It's like the Wall Street for this entire value chain.\nBut the other component of why the costs are high is because so many drugs fail. For each drug that comes to market, Pharma has 20 drugs buried that didn't work. If you have to imagine if they buy 20 drugs for like $100 million each, often the costs are much, much higher. The system is quite inefficient and identifying targets that could work because it's very closed. And there's this principal agent problem in terms of how assets are transacted if I'm selling you a drug as a biotech company, I only have incentive to show you the good data. So we could run 50 studies on this new cancer drug, and like 48 of them show that it doesn't work. And two of them show that it works. One of them is inconclusive, we'll show you the two studies that work. And if you're desperate enough, you will buy it, and then it might work. But also based on if the data was more open source, it could have been identified much earlier that the drug doesn't work. So now let's see them this drug is bought by a large pharma company, they take it into stage one trials that may be working, but also inconclusive. Stage two is a massive failure. And at this point, they've spent an enormous amount of money to discover in stage two that the drug didn't work. This could have been discovered before, this drug was never supposed to go to market in the first place, because it doesn't work. So all the cost of those failed drugs are offset to patients and the end. \nAll of that taken together is what makes drug development so expensive today. So maybe it's a lost analogy, it's a little like if I used to make this analogy in the beginning, if IBM was developing a social media app, and it had a mandate to develop this app for the government, and no one else is allowed to develop a social media app, and it takes them eight years. And it's a really crappy app. And in the end, it cost you $1,000 per month as a subscription fee. And you have to pay 50 cents for every DM that you send on this app. Then they have a 15-year exclusivity on social media apps. And that's a little of how pharma works today. Nothing against IBM at all. By the way, I'm just more using them as an example of, like, software incumbents, and how and so open source software completely changed how we engage with apps. We can ask ourselves, why are apps free? Whereas 20 years ago, you still used to go to like a store and buy a physical CD that had a CD key on it. Pharma is still in that level of innovation, buying a CD at a store with a licence key.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 27:12 \n**_Wow. Okay, so, um, from, you know, from everything, you're telling me just insane inefficiencies that are currently ingrained in the system? And you know, with your interests, which are open source, pharma, economics, Bitcoin, etc, open source, you've started this company called Molecule. So can you tell me what is Molecule, and why is it exciting?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 27:37 \nYeah, of course. So at Molecule, we're really trying to virtualize and decentralize how drug development works. So at the core, like, if you look at this, like from a meta level, the core value drivers in drug development and in biotech and pharma are on the one side, its intellectual property through the form of patents or early stage IP. This is just data around a new molecule. And, on the other side, its data produced about these compounds. So we just talked about these expensive clinical trials and so on. But so, it's companies that claim innovation through a patent, for example, and then they waste funding to produce data. If we think about data, and the data has increasingly become a virtual asset, really since the 70s, and 80s. Before that, we still use that data and like these giant filing cabinets, but data has increasingly become virtual. On the other side, intellectual property has never really become virtual. It's a box of papers that you file from a lawyer, and then granted a patent by the US government. But so, if you think about intellectual property, it's the perfect asset class to virtualize. Because it doesn't exist, right? It exists in terms of being granted a unique right, but it's not like it's something physical. It's not like real estate. It's not like a car. It's intellectual property. What we do at Molecule, we attach both a data and these IP rights to non-fungible tokens (NFT's). And then we bring the core IP into web3. Then we've developed a new framework called an IP-NFT. At Molecule, we think pharma and biotech development as a marketplace. And as I described this pipeline earlier, pharma is one of the last big pipeline models, where IP is owned by a single company and then passes through the pipeline and then eventually brought to market by a single company, and most pipeline business models have been disrupted by marketplace models over the past 20 or 30 years. And we think that, it isn't necessarily about disrupting Pharma. It's about making pharma and biotech development much more efficient. And to bring down the costs both for incumbents, but especially for patients and for researchers. And so what we build is, and maybe to use some crypto terminology, in essence, a mixture between an Open Sea and ResearchGate that enables researchers, biotech companies, universities across the globe, to mint their research and their IP into an IP-NFT. As you can imagine, a drug discovery department at a university can create a portfolio of their research projects through our framework, and put their IP into web3. And what this now does is it makes the intellectual property liquid, which is very hard to achieve in biotech today, like biotech investments tend to be super illiquid, because it takes so long to bring drugs to market. And then you have tractability before but tractability on a patent basis is quite expensive. And NFT's make that really cheap, hyper liquid. And they also enable price discovery around IP, which is another thing that that's really valuable. So typically, you would only have price discovery for IP through, like public market listings. But that's also an inefficient price discovery mechanism, because then you have very stringent reporting around the data.\nSo what we had as an early vision for molecule was to create a curation market. So this is based on some of Simon de la Rouviere is already thinking of like, what if we had markets domains where people could just like, trade and discover and curate the most promising memes? And some of our early thinking was, in essence, hey, wait, “what if we had like a meme market, but for therapeutics for drugs, when our patients researchers could enable in price discovery for therapeutics together”. And now this therapeutics would live off data that people commit, or data that flows into the data repos attached to these drugs that have been researched, which would then garner more attention. And then positive data would increase the price of a therapeutic and negative data would decrease the public perception of price of a therapeutic. This is the baseline of thinking. And so we're working with universities across the globe that upload their IP. And then this could now be purchased by anyone. So we're trying to build the system in a very open way. But on the other side, we started realizing it's probably not going to it's not going to be industry and like industry incumbents that will be first to use new frameworks like this. But ideally, it would be folks that are already in web3 that are native to owning an NFT. But then, we thought it might not be efficient to have the typical, NFT speculator audience engage in this IP, and own it, because ideally, you want to make the IP productive. So the following data emerges, you would then need to define the next steps of the experiments to move this closer to market and move it closer to the patient. So what we started doing, at the same time to make this marketplace productive, is to build biotech DAOs, or we call them bio DAOs, which now function like new biotech research collectives that are comprised of patients, of investors of researchers in that specific therapeutic area. And develop those drugs. So I'm sure many of your listeners are familiar with a DAO called FlamingoDAO. FlamingoDAO is a huge inspiration to us. It's a DAO that curates and collect an amazing collection of NFT artworks. And so we launched, VitaDAO in June last year, June 2021. And VitaDAO builds, curates and collects IP-NFTs focused on longevity research. So this is one of the first fully functioning biotech DAOs that the world has seen. Only focused on longevity. And there's another one that we're building now in psychedelics research focused on psychedelics and mental health. This DAO will, in a similar vein, also be building a portfolio now of these IP assets and making them productive. And there's already a large amount of industry interest to collaborate with entities such as VitaDAO because the industry is really interested in the deal flow that has been created and the IP that has been researched and discovered.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 34:59 \n**_Wow. Okay, so again, incredible, my mind is like just being blown non-stop. But okay, let's go back to Molecule. So I'm a little confused on , and it's my fault. But the efficiency gains you get from putting this data and IP rights onto the NFT. Why is that important? You said that it creates a more liquid market. But if that information is on this NFT, can anyone come claim and read it? And then it's open source? Why is there value attached to that NFT?_**\n‍\nPaul Kolhaas 35:32 \nYeah, of course. So the way that our IP-NFT works, the IP-NFT consists of two core components. So on one side, it's a one to one legal agreement. So Andrew, if you went onto our app, and you find an asset there from your favourite longevity researcher at MIT, and you said, and he's looking to raise some funding for a new set of molecules. This researcher says ”I am looking for $200,000 in funding to complete the experiments.” This will be one way to engage, and then you engage through something that's called a sponsored research agreement. So you, Andrew, it's typically not natural people that do this, but let's just use that as an example, you would then enter into a sublicencing agreement or something that's called a sponsored research agreement with MIT to sponsor the following work. And as a result, you would now own the IP and the data that results from it. And that IP agreement is encrypted.The owner of the IP-NFT, is able to see the licence agreement and everything around it. But the identity of the molecules or the resulting data is not of made available to the public, unless you do that. On the one side, it's a legal agreement for someone to license you a a certain amount of work, a certain amount of IP. And on the other side, it's a data storage layer that lives on top of [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io). Some metadata is on our wiki, some of it is on [Areweave](https://www.arweave.org/), it's an encrypted data access control system. To make that very simple, the NFT now is linked to decentralized Google Drive, where you as the NFT, holder, get to grant access rights to different parties. So the researcher now uploads his or her data into that data storage, and you get to see it, and you get to give other people access. So now you can say, “I want to give access to another research team that I also want to be working on this. And I'm going to pay them another 100k. And they are going to deliver the following data assets into this repo as well”. You could also show your friend at Harvard Medical School, he's been looking into this , and you tell him about this work, and use it very easily simply grant them access rights. And then a year later, like a biotech comes along, and they hear about the asset, and they're interested in looking at it. So you're like, cool, let me grant them access rights as well. They can DD some work through your granted access rights, and then they make you a bid on the chain to buy the IP-NFT from you. Yeah. So just to explain how the IP-NFT works. But the really cool thing about this now is this data is typically stored on company on servers, it's transacted like PDFs and emails, they're granting access control to the data stores that are described as follows the same NDA as patterns. So like, if you're the owner, you obviously don't want to invalidate your own IP, right? At the same time, if you wanted to, you could just open up access to that data repo. It's like having a private GitHub repo that you can add different collaborators to, or making it a public GitHub repo. And, at the point, if you decided now to patent this discovery, or these molecules, what the IP-NFT now grants you is everything that you need to go to the patent office with. It's saying, you're the legal owner, you out licensed this from MIT. And here's all the data that proves that this could work in the following indication, based on that you could be granted a patent. And this 9is what makes the whole research really valuable. The cool thing about this is now you can transact both the data and the IP, like the legal rights in the same way that I can send you a crypto kitty on my phone like a crypto fund, you could also now make the IP fractional. So VitaDAO is currently exploring fractionalizing, one of its first IP-NFTs. That doesn't mean again that the holders of those fractions get to access the IP, they get to access the data. But you can build all sorts of funky open source collaboration methods in there. For example, you could say, if someone contributes to the following dataset which I need to develop this from some university, for example, you say, hey, anyone who can do the mouse studies gets 2% of the asset. And then some university can say, hey, we're interested in this work. And we can do the mouse studies, we will take 2%. And we also want 20k from you, but it's not going to cost 150k that it normally costs. So you're starting to decentralize ownership of the asset, and make the whole development process much more modular.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 40:22 \n**_Okay. Is it fair to say that Molecule if we had to give Molecule a one-liner, Molecule is a drug development research marketplace? Is that a simple one-liner?_**\n‍\nPaul Kolhaas 40:36 \nYeah, you could also I mean, we, you could say, for example, decentralized biotech protocol.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 40:40 \n**_Okay. Okay, that sounds way better. And then would you say the mission of molecule is to broadly open up the market? So, you know, to more participants? So more research happens?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 40:53 \nYes, absolutely. So it's a way to democratize access, in the same way that the internet democratize access to information. I think for us, this is really about democratizing access to medicine. And if we think about this whole development process, there are two user groups that are enormously user groups in the sense of like, this is a value creation process. There are two user groups that are fundamentally disenfranchised today. And those are researchers, the people that are doing the work, they don't typically see no upside, unless they go in like it really into the hardcore, like biotech, VC, biotech startup, like IPO route, which many of them don't want. They are really keen to provide value to patients. That's why they became researchers in the first place. But we want to empower researchers to become co-owners of the IP and of the upside. And on the other hand, patients are really the most disenfranchised people in this entire process. But they're the ones that stand to benefit the most, and that need access to new medicine. And you'd be surprised, for example, how much a cancer patient, how much a rare disease patient, are familiar with their disease, about the potential treatments about what might work for them and what couldn't. And the current system just completely removes them from that process. If you have a disease, you, you get what's on the market, you don't get to determine its price, you have no influence on that. I think this has enormous potential. And the same way that lets say NFT's empowered, in many cases, disenfranchised artists across the globe, to take power again, of, of their creations. I think this similar thing is happening in the music industry at the moment. We believe that NFT's in the medical space, and like these IP-NFTs can really fundamentally empower the creators and the benefactors of a therapeutic.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 42:54 \n**_Okay, so I definitely see how everything that you've built so far is massively more efficient than the current system. And just better overall, but how did the regulatory agencies interact with that is, are they still a massive inefficiency and blocker?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 43:14 \nWe are currently really focused on, early stage, preclinical development. Getting IP out of university and getting financing, for a researcher or a laboratory or a team that is looking for, 500k, at 200k 500k, maybe up to a million to complete the preclinical studies. To overcome something that's known as the valley of death. In this entire process, a lot of innovation never even makes it out of academia, and many, many precede and like seed stage, biotech companies just die, not because their innovation wasn't good, just because like there's a lack of funding, there is a lack of discoverability it's really difficult to discover this IP today and know what's in the market. Pfizer, for example, has for the entirety of North America has 12 drug scouts, business development managers, that are trying to source IP and work with universities to find IP. Coming back to your question, we tend to be quite focused at the moment on early stage development, where the regulatory overhead is quite small so that the regulatory overhead really increases. Once you move into the clinical stage once you file for an IND. I think as a crypto project that's really trying to bridge into the real world, it's super important to pick your niche. So we're really focused on the early stages of development at the moment. We're also the funding requirements alive and the regulatory overhead is quite low. So these IP-NFT's are fully forward compatible, they can be purchased by a biotech company or a pharma company that can then continue developing the drug. So for the time being, I think and also, while the web3 space is still quite small, we're really trying to accelerate innovation in their early stages to broaden the funnel. So enabling more great therapeutics to come into the clinical stage in the first place, but knowing very well that we won't have the capacity yet, I think even as a community, to skew it to a clinical trial. I think over time, though, like the DAOs that we're building could really start doing their own clinical trials, I think that would be an absolute dream, they can create their own spin off companies and then could orchestrate clinical trials. But I think for the time being there's just not enough liquidity and enough real world integrations for that to work efficiently.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 45:55 \n**_So can you walk me through like the dream scenario from start to finish of research and drug development if people are utilizing Molecule and beat it down and all these other all this all these other products and things that you guys are building? Yeah, just walk me through from start to finish how that would work like on a mechanical level_.**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 46:16 \nOkay, that's a big question.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 46:18 \n**_You can make it super simple like the person at MIT researching a drug then me as investor, I go buy the thing and so on so forth._**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 46:28 \nResearch at MIT developing a rare disease molecule that can be promising, gets financed by a rare disease DAO that also finds this approach really promising, kicks off initial studies, with the like, 300k in financing that she received. IP-NFT is now co owned by a researcher at 10%, University 20%. and rare disease DAO owns 70%. Rare Disease DAO initially now commission's an initial findings are promising, rare disease DAO commissions to CRO's, one in Singapore, one in India, to also begin working on this compound, all of those data flows and pays them both in in in shares in the IP-NFT. So like in sub tokens of the IP-NFT as well as in fiat, those additional data flows start flowing into the IP-NFT. Together with another rare disease patient foundation, IP-NFT is then spun into a small biotech company that is almost already at IND approval stage, all the data was procured in a fraction of the time as it normally would. Because of the rare disease, DAO is working with other researchers and a legal counsel that have helped shape and just expedite the value of the IP and what experiments to focus on very quickly. And then a biotech company is formed and is fully owned by patients and by this rare disease DAO which also mainly consists of patients, but also investors. And ultimately, a biotech company is able to get funding from that structure, you probably then need about 10 million, 20 million plus in funding to perform the first stages of clinical trials. First stages of clinical trials are quite promising, which prompts the interest now of a larger, pharmaceutical company. And now patient groups and pharma company agree that the DAO will continue financing the asset together with pharma company, but pharma company will start expediting all the clinical trials just because they have a much bigger machinery in the current system to do that. And the part of that agreement is that once the drug reaches the market, it will not be sold, that's an over maybe 4x, or like 3x, the cost of what it took what the entire development took, provided that both pharma company and like rare disease DAO, continue to share the cost of the development. Again, three years later, drug maybe gets FDA approval, that will be incredibly that would be incredibly fast. But think if you do more efficient coordination, around trials that could be possible. And an end result could be, you now have a drug that is still a majority patient owned. We're also a pharma company is making money off of it, but their input was much lower. So they're also happy to take a much lower cut on future revenue. And our pharma company uses their supply chain and their network of pharmacies very efficiently distribute this drug to doctors and to patients without needing to overcharge on it to make up for their losses in other areas.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 50:03 \n**_No, amazing. Yeah, thank you for that overview, I think I'm beginning to understand the full process from start to finish here. So the DAOs are a super essential part of this whole structure here. And the first DAO that you help set up is called VitaDAO and you wanted to focus on longevity research. Was there a reason that you wanted to focus on longevity research first?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 50:29 \nYeah, I personally think longevity research is a fascinating, interesting topic. It's like the holy grail of medicine. And longevity is fascinating also from an economic perspective, because, longevity is not about living for longevity research in my eyes is not about living forever. It's about living a much healthier, longer lifespan. So what if you could reach in like the age of 120, 130, 140? I think it gets critical after that. But without the typical onset of age related diseases such as Alzheimer's, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer. So, the question is more, how could we live a longer, healthier end of life without the bad side effects that come with it, it's the reason people don't want to get old, because you have so many really shitty age related diseases that sit on, and those also cause massive costs to society. So, I think it's a really cool mission. And then I'm ageing research touches many areas of medicine, which for us, as a marketplace and as a protocol, is interesting because it allows us to quickly branch out into all sorts of disease areas. So that's the second reason. The third reason is, I think, ageing research should fundamentally be democratized. So the bulk of ageing, and longevity startups are currently funded by billionaires. And it's quite obvious if you've made a lot of money in your life, you want to live it out for as long as you can. But I think there's a risk there. Because if like the richest people in the world live longer and longer and get richer and richer, that will fundamentally, in the long run, create and an unjust society, because wealth isn't distributed as much any more. If I don't know if a bad leader of a country can now go on his fifth or sixth or seventh presidency term enabled by longevity therapeutics, that won't be good, but it's so at least let's ensure that access to longevity Therapeutics is democratic and not so centralized in the hands of the few. And then the last point is, as a community and as a marketplace, tend to be super conscious of product market fit with web3. And so for the time being, I think it would be quite difficult to launch, a DAO focused on breast cancer research. And it's not that breast cancer research isn't a like a really important topic. It's simply that the patient groups in that are affected by breast cancer wouldn't be as native to using discord and Twitter and Metamask as the people that are interested in longevity research. I think that comes over time. One thing that I'm, really excited about is , lots of patient communities are already quite digital. They tend to have like massive Facebook groups where they coordinate events online, but they're not like they're not in Discord yet. And so lots of web3 folks that I know got really interested in longevity research, lots of web3 people that are also interested in psychedelic research. So those are just areas and therapeutic areas that I think have a natural product market fit for us at the moment. As we are still in the early days of building out.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 53:53 \n**_Awesome. Okay, so August of last year, VitaDAO, I think, you guys were able to transfer some sort of IP on chain as NFT. Can you describe what that was?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 54:04 \nYeah, absolutely. So that was one of the first full end to end out licensing events with a university. This was with a professor and the leader of a laboratory called Dr. Morten Scheibye-Knudsen. He heads up the ageing, the Scheibye-Knudsen lab and the ageing Research Lab at the University of Copenhagen. So this is a study that's ongoing, that's analysing 10 molecules that could have life extenuating properties. And VitaDAO in this case now out licensed the full IP from the university, paid for the research. The research has joined VitaDAOitself and also now participates in the governance of VitaDAO through the Vita token. So they receive tokens in the organization, which is fascinating because now these researchers also actively bringing in other researchers , and they bring in other interesting work that they're doing you to receive funding. Yeah, so this, this research was attached fully to an IP-NFT. And then VitaDAO did purchase the IP-NFT. And the funds went to the University to kick off the work. And now, we've seen other research groups within VidaDAO that are building on this research, and they also want to collaborate with this first study that they're doing. Which is really exciting. So you see these other researchers that come in that hear about the work , and they're like, “Hey, I have a thesis here as well. And we should also investigate the following thing, and I can then make it a part of, of the work that you guys are already doing”. The work itself is about repurposing 10 molecules that have life extending properties statistically, from a huge data set of the Danish population's medical records that they analysed, so that the lab received access to from the Danish government and that they analysed. And based on this, now they're running through a series of studies. And these molecules can then be repurposed, most likely through an analogue strategy, to potentially bring entirely new longevity therapeutics to market.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 56:15 \n**_Okay, so if I am a regular person, that's not as, some sort of research scientists or drug development scientists, what part can I play in VitaDAO?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 56:28 \nSo, yeah, so if you do that, it's quite interesting. If you go into the Discord, you have a mix between lots of people that are just really interested in longevity research. But like you said, they're not researchers. They're not scientists, but they want to contribute to the field, they want to learn more about it, they want to connect with researchers. And then I'd say the core of the DAO is really what is called the longevity working group, which at this point, is over again, probably over 100 scientists from across the world, I'd say about 60 of them working very actively. In some cases, we have MD PhDs from Harvard, we have professors that were leading laboratories that have left their academic past almost full time to work on this. And they are now constantly bringing in research to be funded by VitaDAO. And as VitaDAO token holder, you can on the one side influence the direction of what work you would like to see funded. For example, you might have heard about a new, exciting supplement or a new exciting research policy, so you could actively begin engaging those researchers asked him about it, and also suggest specific things to receive funding. But ultimately, this longevity working group will then make proposals to the DAO and token holders to vote on what research should get funded. And also, then if like positive results are found over time, you as a token holder also then get to decide as a next step, what to do with the research, which I also find really exciting. So, like, VitaDAO could. And this goes back to something I said in the very beginning, about potentially open sourcing IP. So like, that's just a hypothetical scenario, if VitaDAO discovered a groundbreaking new molecule that could make, every human on Earth, at least 200 years old, and then read it, I thought this is far too big to ever be owned by a single company. It's too influential, terribly commercialized. Let's open source it. So VitaDAO token holders could decide to just open source IP that they develop. However, they could also decide to sell it to a biotech company. And then, any proceeds that come into VitaDAO through this process would be re reinvested into further research. So we hope that VitaDAO becomes this just growing and growing decentralized collective, that now democratically manages its IP, and engages in a much more open process and philosophical design thinking around how IP should be managed by humanity. Yeah, so this is how you could engage.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 59:11 \n**_That's so freaking cool. It's insane. Alright, so your long term vision is that there are different DAOs that are focused on different pharmaceutical markets or focuses, like, for example, you said the next DAO that you're you want to launch will focus on psychedelics and mental health. And there'll be another one called rare disease DAO and so on so forth. So in your mind, there's going to be many DAOs, each focus on different sectors of this market?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 59:41 \nSo we hope I mean, we, so what we're increasingly doing is we're building the DAO frameworks to enable that, because as a community, and as a network, we don't want to be in a position to launch all of these. They require an enormous amount of domain specific knowledge and specialization. And they're also best in the hands of researchers and patients or people that are really affected by these diseases. So where we're like, we're actively building some of them out. But over time, we hope that there will be a sprawling ecosystem that emerges that builds on our frameworks are built on other frameworks, and help brings biotech dollars to life. And then I think initially, these organizations will, as I, as I explained earlier, we feel this like preclinical funding gap, and we need just accelerate, help accelerate early stage research and innovation. Because that's where there's a huge need. But then over time, if they grow large enough, they can increasingly really move into the clinical trial stages.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:00:49 \n**_Awesome, awesome. All right. So let's fast-forward now, 5 / 10 years from now, what is your grand vision for everything that you're currently working on?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:01:00 \nI think the really grand vision is that a first drug that that was enabled and discovered in this process reaches patients. I think that could really happen in a five to 10 year timeframe, I would be, I'd be really happy. And more so if that drug was developed at a fraction of the cost. Because I think this is what's really possible. And that's what's really possible we found so incredible about the emergence of VitaDAO was that VitaDAO turned into like a mid-sized biotech company within just comparatively in terms of staff and in terms of knowledge, in terms of expertise. But in the course of three to six months, and with much, much less funding, and often driven by people that are just really passionate about doing this, like drug development doesn't have to be like it sadly, today, it's really often about profits just about like revenue, because you have a giant VC funded ecosystem that is optimizing for that. But I think we should optimize, for patient centric, healthcare. And if you then have people that are working, that not on a voluntary basis, but you can coordinate people to produce the same outcomes at much lower costs. So this many ways, obviously, that this ecosystem can go, we're trying to build it in a very open source way. So also, if you want to create a DAO that is highly focused on like, just maximizing profits from IP entities, you can obviously do that as well. So we're not I think we're not trying to build, we're trying to build this system out as a very open and free marketplace. But I think what would be really cool to see in the next five to 10 years is one of these IP-NFT based drugs reaching patients, and doing so at a much lower cost than is possible in the current system.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:03:03 \n**_Amazing. Awesome. All right. All right. Paul, are you ready for the closing questions? Yes, yeah. Awesome. All right. What is your single favourite NFT that you own?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:03:27 \nDo you know sad girls?\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold\n**_No, I don't._**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:03:27 \nIt's called sad girl's bar. It's like a project by a really cool female artist called Glam Beckett. And the principal is just it's like these sad girls. They like to have pizza slices in their hand. And it's like black and white and a golf look. I find it funny. I think it's great. And I somehow got into the position of owning sad girls number one, so if there's any sad girls fans out there, reach out to me.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:03:54 \n**_I love it. I love it. Yeah, normally I hear like, punk sport, apes, etc. But I've never heard sad girls. So very, very cool. All right, what is your most controversial thought relating to the drug development industry?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:04:08 \nProbably that if our legal system changed, that we could treat drug development like software. Ultimately, like developing drugs, it's impossible to do open source drug development today because of our legal system. But ultimately, drugs once you get into producing them, they cost nothing, in example the cost of a pill is virtually zero, especially, once you get into chemical production, but these drugs are sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. And it's really, really reminiscent in some sense of the software development industry in the late 90s and early 2000s. So I think, most controversial thought, I do believe drug development could be like software development.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:04:57 \n**_That's awesome. Okay, so could we do it safely without the government?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:05:04 \nDefinitely. Yeah. What we're seeing more and more emerge in the web3 space is very sound, self-regulating processes and principles. I think if you, if you have completely open systems, people will self regulate, and the government often regulates, I think, in very bad ways. And over time, that regulation often becomes self-serving through lobbyism. If you just we really have to ask ourselves, like, what job has half the FDA done, in some cases, in terms of like protecting US citizens from the opioid crisis? I think it's so painfully obvious that some of these regulatory processes have hurt patients and consumers more than they protected them. And I'm sure, I'm not based in the US, but I'm sure there's a long story that people can tell about the justice, the financial regulation in the web3 space, and the role of government there.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:06:04 \n**_All right, you can snap your fingers and instantly solve one issue in the drug development research industry. What would it be?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas\nPatents!\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold\n**_Okay, so I explained that._**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:06:16 \nI mean, yeah, I think it's based on what we had before. If we had IP protection, that was more like open source licensing frameworks, as opposed to patents. We could develop, engage in much more open drug development. So if I could snap my fingers, I would hope that licensing frameworks in the pharma industry could effectively replace patents as drivers and protectors of innovation.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:06:49 \n**_Amazing, alright, who is someone that you look up to? And why?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:06:55 \nI hate myself was No, I don't hate myself for saying this. But like, I do look up to Elon Musk on the one side, I think he's such a funny troll. Sometimes, have the audacity to just go out and say that stuff. But on the other side, I think he's someone who's inspired a whole generation of builders, and likes to push for the limits of what is possible. “if you want to, like, you can't just decide to go to Mars” and “if you stick with it for long enough, then like you have a fighting chance of doing that”. And I think with that type of behaviour, anything is possible. It's something our younger generations used to get that from political leaders, and presidents. Unfortunately, that isn't the case any more. Today, I don't know anyone, or very few people, who look up to our political leaders. But I think Elon is someone who really inspires us to build and to push new boundaries. And to push for a better world. Oh, and Vitalik Buterin as well.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:08:08 \n**_All right. Last question. Where do you see IP-NFTs in three years?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:08:15 \nIn three years, I think we could see a similar highly liquid market around IP assets through IP-NFTs. I don't think fractionalization makes as much sense for normal NFTs, for example having fractions of a punk, I even think having fractions of the Mona Lisa. Okay, it's fun , but you can't actively engage with it. But for the IP-NFT, I think we could have a much, much more fractional market over time. So if you have this drug, and it has a specific patient population, or you have a bunch of researchers working on it, it would make a lot of sense for it to become factional. So now, you as a patient could say, “Hey, there's this new, rare disease”. And then there's a new drug and development that you hear about, and it has the form of an IP-NFT or several IP-NFTs. And now you can contribute funding that. You can take $2,000 of your money, and say, “I'm going to contribute funding to this research”. And now you don't just know, you get to govern the future of that asset. And you get to have a voice in terms of what the actual drug should be priced when it comes to market. I think that's really powerful. So yeah, I really hope that we can enable that market to exist. And for IP to become a public domain.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:09:47 \n**_Amazing, awesome. Paul, this was just mind-boggling. I feel like I just did a college level no beyond college, course, and everything about drug development, drug discovery, etc. And it's really cool to see NFTs being used and in a way that truly matter, not that all the other use cases don't matter. But we're talking about like our health, which is obviously the most important thing. And so it's just super inspiring to hear everything that you're doing and building. If people want to find out more about yourself, find out more about molecule or VitaDAO, where should they go? What should they do?_**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:10:18 \nAbsolutely, yeah. So you can find me on Twitter. My DMs are open, please feel free to connect. If you're excited about this use case. It's @paulkhls. On Twitter, we're @molecule_dao. Also, you'll easily find VitaDAO. Yeah, we're constantly looking for people that are just as excited about this use cases we are, so please feel free to reach out. And our website is molecule.to.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:10:46\n**_Amazing, Paul, thank you so much for coming on. I really, really appreciate it._**\n‍\nPaul Kohlhaas 1:10:49 \nThank you so much for your time. And yeah, I had a lot of fun speaking to you, and yeah, hope to speak. Speak soon.\n‍\nAndrew Steinwold 1:10:57 \n**_Awesome, man. Thank you. Hey, everyone.

This project will generate important knowledge to contribute to our understanding of the effects of microdosing.\n_*The contents of this article were taken from the application of researchers Thomas Anderson & Rotem Petranker in their formal submission of their study to participate in the Catalyst launch. Texts have been simplified and shortened for the purposes of this post._\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/624741d7d57480c3fff71f34_molecule-dao-psychedelics.png)\n## Project Summary\nThe University of Toronto Mississauga’s Psychedelic Science Research Program is looking to raise funding for it’s latest research project through Molecule Catalyst as a platform. This funding will go to a rigorous, high-impact clinical trial to study the effects of microdosing psilocybin, the primary psychedelic compound found in ‘magic’ mushrooms, to improve cognitive function and to alleviate negative mood symptoms. The trial will employ an advanced placebo-controlled design to identify whether microdosing psychedelics provide similar effects compared to the ones at higher doses.\n> _“Microdosing is the practice of regularly consuming sub-hallucinogenic quantities of psychedelic substances.”_\n‍\nThe primary research targets are:\n  * **Creativity**\n  * **Mood**\n  * **Focus**\n\n\nSeveral other constructs identified in previous research will also be measured, such as:\n  * Social connection\n  * Self-efficacy\n  * Mindfulness\n\n\nand will result in a rich source of exploratory analyses that will provide a critical precedent for legal, responsible, and impactful psychedelics research.\nThe study is expected to kick off data collection in January 2020 and will continue for 1–1.5 years with 10 cohorts of 10 participants per cohort. Thomas Anderson & Rotem Petranker make up the power duo team leading the study with a diverse support network of expert scientific advisors covering psychology, clinical science, pharmacy, and psychiatry, including Prof. Dan Ariely and Dr. James Fadiman.\n## Background & Significance\nDespite growing interest in both public and scientific communities, there is no evidence demonstrating a reliable causal relationship between microdosing and its purported benefits.\nConcerningly, there is also no evidence describing the safety or efficacy of microdosing practices. To address this gap between positive public appeal and limited research evidence, the scientific team proposes the world’s first clinical trial on psilocybin microdoses using pharmaceutical grade psilocybin.\n> _“This project will provide the first Open Science, hypothesis-driven, quantitative study of microdosing efficacy on a variety of commonly purported benefits and safety concerns.”_\n**What sets this study apart:**\n  * Open science\n  * Clinical grade psilocybin\n  * Controlled testing environment (not self-administered informal reporting)\n  * High-quality data collection\n  * Double-blind testing\n  * Pre-registration\n\n\n## Open Science\nOne crucial aspect of their work that sets this study apart is the use of Open Science and pre-registration. In short, pre-registration is the most robust way to do science, the way the team believes it should be done. It holds scientists to the highest standard in the field as hypotheses and analyses need to be locked in beforehand, demonstrating a commitment to scientific integrity and intellectual honesty. We hope that the use of Open Science will stand as the gold standard for other psychedelic researchers to strive for (see this piece on [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/opening-up-the-future-of-psychedelic-science-101303) for more on this).\n## Why should you care?\nMental illness affects 20% of children and adolescents worldwide, and nearly 300 million people globally are suffering from Major Depressive disorder, with a recorded 800,000 suicides recorded each year.\nMounting evidence suggests psilocybin, a natural psychedelic compound, can introduce neuroplasticity in treatment-resistant depression ([Carhart-Harris et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201784?platform=oscar&draft=collection)). Psychedelics may also promote openness, curiosity, and creative thinking ([Anderson et al., 2019a, 2019b; Prochazkova et al., 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-018-5049-7)).\nMicrodosing research is particularly important given the disparity between the prevalence of mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety and the resources to address acute phase mental illness, and this problem in itself is becoming a trillion-dollar issue.\n## Who will be participating in the study?\n*Participants will be thoroughly screened to ensure that the sample includes healthy, low-risk participants who fit a profile of subclinical persistent depressive and/or anxiety disorders that may be addressed by the intervention. A detailed medical history will be reviewed by a physician and current medication use will be reviewed by a pharmacist. A psychiatrist will be on-call to ensure participant safety throughout the duration of the study.\n## How will they do it?\nThe study will be using a randomized, double-blind clinical “crossover washout design” (see explainer graphic below) that is run over an 8 week period.\n  1. What this means is that on the first day, participants will be randomized into 4 weeks of either: i) weekly consumption of a placebo or ii) weekly microdoses of psilocybin (3mg).\n  2. After 4 weeks, groups will “cross over”, i.e. the placebo-first group will begin receiving psilocybin and the psilocybin-first group will receive a placebo.\n\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6247429915e4d569918bd2ee_molecule-dao-crossover-wash-design.png)\nHaving some participants receive psilocybin before the placebo allows us to assess whether beneficial effects “wash out” over the subsequent 4-week placebo period.\n## What will come from this study?\nThe community can expect that **all data gathered and materials used will be made open source**.\nThis includes the release of open access papers, presentations of the findings in conferences and knowledge mobilization pieces.\nThe team aims to develop a multi-study follow-up plan using data collected from this study, including studies on treatment for specific indications using novel investigations into neural mechanisms and possible drug development pathways for psilocybin-related derivatives. If all goes well, the team can**begin running the next frontier of psychedelic research far ahead of anyone else in the world**.\n## Next steps & Support\nThis is only the first project to be added to Molecule Catalyst, and other exciting announcements are to follow in the areas of Biogerontology (Aging & Longevity) as well as in Rare Diseases.\nYOU can play an active role in helping this scientific study becoming a reality.\nWe would love to get support and feedback from the community and there are many different ways for you to get involved!\nIn just a few short weeks you’ll be able to actively donate to campaigns like the above project on our platform using Dai.\n  * If you’re interested in diving deeper into how our market-making mechanisms work you can watch our quick 20-minute explanation on the community [Curation Markets call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzUCusO2kpI&t=2s), or dive into the [Architecture article](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/engineering-a-novel-incentive-scheme-for-crowdfunding-6f8df696565a) on our blog.\n  * If you’d like to submit a research project you can [complete this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6KWvf68w9FMqMXHLJYfS2DBfwW7sxVgqLchoK3ZBj_S5rKA/viewform) on our website or drop us an email.\n  * If you would like to stay updated & follow the latest project updates, then sign up at the bottom of this form and we’ll let you know as soon as we’ve launched and you can start participating!\n\n\n_*_ **_Please note_** _that the information included in this article is not exhaustive, the content has been shortened for the reader for the purpose of communicating the basis of the study.

We're all logged in, whether we choose to be or not. Some of us are grinding for XP, increasing the skill and resources of our character. Others are watching from the sidelines as our avatar slowly loses health. There is one universal truth for all of us in this game: it will end. \nLet's face it, death is the final boss. It's the _game over_ screen nobody wants to see. But what if you could develop your own infinite health cheat code? What if we could keep playing the game indefinitely?\nEnter the world of longevity research, where science can potentially unlock the secret to extended playtime — a.k.a. lifespan.\n## The Longevity Trilemma\nFinding this cheat code isn’t easy. If it were, we would have found it already. To change how our bodies interact with time, we need better potions (supplements), better gear (drugs), and better strategies ([regimens](https://app.jove.com/science-education/v/14419/concepts/drug-dosage-regimen-overview)). But like any cheat code, it’s only good if you know it actually works. When it comes to longevity, having proof-of-cheat-code is a must — after all, we only have one “life” in this game. So how do we know what works?\nHuman trials? Too slow. Testing on mice? Still too slow. Consider this, there are more potential drug compounds than atoms in the universe! When it comes to longevity, you don’t want to settle for any option—you want the best.\nThese dynamics create a Longevity Trilemma, and longevity research must balance three key factors: \n  1. **Speed:** We need results fast. Time is ticking. \n  2. **Cost:** It can't break the wallet. We have to efficiently use resources to test the large chemical space.\n  3. **Quality:** The data must accurately predict how drug candidates will impact the lifespan of humans.\n\n\nAI can help, but it needs lots of top-notch training data to propose potential life-extending treatments. So, how do we strike the perfect balance?\n### The Longevity Drug Testing Protocol \nBased on all available information, we believe a protocol to test new combinations to optimize human lifespan is as follows. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66eeb24742dacbdc2f853e0a_AD_4nXeeDOtxgykF7CvL82MCCIXiFs7ZmfEaYGXmuNeDZ6ANNm6y4182JEQnV2eI6ks1U5kv7IPFEAo65ZpSWEOwl17QKW7uBYrNJNrWoOCffz-KDu8WFsIuQQ_5p-mC9FP7ZTIWmJsveCmw1WqKRG8G5js3jqsN.png)\n_Inspired by Rapamycin Longevity Lab LOOP Pipeline._\nTesting compounds in _C. elegans_ (worms) → [_Daphnia Magna_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphnia_magna) or _Drosophila Melanogaster_ (fruit flies) → mice → rats → 1 human → 2 humans → n + 1 humans → broader public. This protocol ensures that data is generated on the least expensive organisms with the shortest lifespan before taking on more risk to cost and health.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66eeb25c49b4a37e1662d9c9_AD_4nXfdGg09XIglfrmu-j0Bzqhzlhs5GTEz086kOB7tEcOLcD0mXtrTDtKyzaE4AeAtTLg1-TjC0TOfcBcUY6u0svJ6AJqLva70O_yG7rXanmwQbA6ZIeJ-i7Ifv_ujHlObumD9UFRctyoWIv_UvYYikgR3aS8.png)\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66eeb26c8e0d43f23bb23917_AD_4nXeLEp9mL3fve43y-drmOtUWjLMxcx6Ju05L17oPZEdXWS_t7QD5n9khwDURPJJl7i4AU6oHoTVHWv0bAowb7HvX1xP2_F-pqUWbkHP27gjxKkamcZ0xQO3QnbhXDPHOl2MxjBwEvg9N_PEaEqHqsHS6dUvL.png)\nIf a regimen proves effective on _C.elegans_ , further experiments can be run on [flies](https://www.trackedbio.com/FlyBox.html) or [mice](https://www.trackedbio.com/MouseWatcher.html), with live data streamed to users. The goal is to eventually bring online testing on worms, and other organisms as well, letting the market decide which regimens and experiments should be performed among the menu of options.\nOf course, regimens can enter at any point in the protocol (e.g. “mouse” instead of “C elegans”) based on the proposed mechanism of action and the financial and personal health risk profile of those funding or taking the regimen. \nMinimizing cost and health risk is what makes _C elegans_ the ideal first experiment. \n## Enter the Wormbot: The Unlikely Speedrunner\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66eeb2988e819b396df32e77_AD_4nXf7ERZKEH97pAyb6Y6_rhducQ1PseJk_ZinohoQlFqhaTZ9LBR5eZYXvsx946UB-NhSsOLbCDi9KRlMiTBSw2adAJrugqzY4PbRHQT5YFRQy45L-UMzTCDodIvNdVfS6PeySGQl-Y5DZrE0q27FV9m4cndq.png)\nMeet Wormbot, our unlikely hero in our quest for immortality.\nThe Wormbot is a low-cost, rapid experimental platform developed by [Ora Biomedical](https://orabiomedical.com/), founded by [Matt Kaeberlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kaeberlein) and [Mitchell Lee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3e91kjmD-o7t83_qNS6mLnG48QDIcCHoiSl8iRz-4A/edit) to inexpensively test a large number of potential longevity regimens on _C. elegans_ , a worm with a lifespan of 20 days. \nWhy worms? Well, 40% of their proteins are similar to ours. They're like the tutorial level for human biology. Plus, they've shown an impressive correlation with how treatments affect mice's lifespans. It's not a 1:1 match for humans by any means, but it's a great starting point. The [data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3e91kjmD-o7t83_qNS6mLnG48QDIcCHoiSl8iRz-4A/edit) from the chart below shows that compounds extending life in mice also extend life in the worms.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66eeb2ab93048af2c65c99c6_AD_4nXcXMpjkbSYQVkj8vx5nEMpEUr3vVBV1VtDJKtPXkZzSBLmdjalW8hMoKDgKG4qZcIFUfz9YTa618Tnaa4wet3I7iSImu2lo68JaZOzYuLOm_TThiV8WonW26kVxLA08atpaGU6tpw-TgL2cPuShUFAVsvnR.png)\n‍\nRegimens are cultured with ~30 worms per well, monitored by a camera recording the worms’ movement and lifespan. This platform can be used to inexpensively test whether regimens may increase the lifespan in larger organisms (mice and humans). \n## Pump.Science: Where Crypto Meets Immortality\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66eeb2dc8e53625aa1ce8f04_AD_4nXeb2uhBtp68EuONWHfQRaLzDbQuY_2iq1Wo0SgGtRVmDbeVFk3CVfNG9BrOrgewz4W14d7VJgfh_USTOCsy15i2m73-i47yHTNcoNdMJKzw80mloR4cDpCVeUZff2rxwkn250C7dH9_CgXUVsPX2FfMqknx.png)\nThis is where you come in. Pump.science is a platform that lets anyone submit longevity regimen ideas (drug strategies) to be tested on the Wormbot (and soon - other experiments), own the intellectual property (IP), and stream the results. It’s like gladiators in the Coliseum, if the Coliseum were a petri dish, the gladiators were microscopic worms, and their weapons were experimental longevity cocktails. Are you not entertained?\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66eeb3d849b4a37e16647682_66eeb34ec8b7454737a1de71_Screenshot%25202024-09-21%2520at%25207.51.11%25E2%2580%25AFAM.png)\n‍\nHere's how it works:\n  1. Submit a regimen idea or back someone else's by buying tokens\n  2. Once the regimen reaches a certain market cap, the Wormbot experiment is run\n  3. Watch the experiment data stream as the regimen is tested on **real** worms\n  4. Buy tokens if you think the compounds can extend life and the regimen is valuable\n\n\nThe goal? Predict which treatments extend human lifespan. We're swapping financial yield (APY) for \"time yield\" – Percentage Life Extension (PLE). \n### Gamifying the Longevity Game\nPump.science gamifies the Wormbot. The objective of the game is to predict whether a longevity regimen will increase lifespan in humans using the worm experiments as a signal. The higher the PLE, the greater the chance of winning. \nTo play, users either submit a regimen for testing, which launches a new token, or fund others’ regimen ideas by purchasing their regimens’ tokens. \nTo submit a regimen for testing, users can select from a list of available ones.\nTo buy tokens in an existing regimen, users can choose live tokens from the marketplace of all the regimens currently being tested. \nFor each regimen’s market, users see a stream of the latest images taken by the Wormbot and some raw data (movement, growth) that can serve as leading indicators for whether the regimen is increasing lifespan. \nIn other words, pump.science turns Wormbot into a tokenized prediction market for longevity regimens with a goal of increasing PLE in humans. \n## Why is the platform called pump.science?\n[Pump.fun](http://pump.fun) is a token launchpad on the Solana blockchain that launched in January 2024 and amassed well over 100 billion USD in volume in a period of months, and is now responsible for the greatest number of transactions on the Solana blockchain. The key innovation of pump.fun is enabling the creator economy for meme tokens, lowering the cost of creating a new coin to $2. \nPump.science is built on top of pump.fun, so we called it pump.science. The key innovation of pump.science is enabling a creator economy for science tokens, starting with longevity regimens, by lowering the barrier to entry to fundraise and execute lifespan experiments while streaming the data for maximum transparency on the performance of each regimen. In other words, it’s pump.fun for science. \nWe want to lower the friction to submitting, supporting, and justifying the products that will increase the duration of our lives.\n‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66eeb388d138f6c63ebbb5df_AD_4nXdXh02Dd3ahfdYlh9mM-wHumY1Kk0q5pcIUVsUs7wfLoCZFdrR_KRPXUklTJ6NanA_stOSJV-IMg_Zzj56y1GRU-Ehdjk4VYPXU7sIC7wMsAPbld8S9a7x5ZPij1STrpQ-Vy1O5BAlHKe1WTaZCzyjNDr2k.png)\nThis kind of _stadium science_ , scientific research with live, open-sourced data and real-time speculation, has not been sufficiently explored. Traditional biotech markets release data once experiments (typically clinical trials) are completed. Real-time data readouts in stadium science provide more opportunities for odds to change and enable continuous speculation by market participants. Participants can look at the data and make educated guesses on a continuous basis - either based on their _a priori_ scientific understanding or by watching the experiment run. To propose a new regimen will likely require a deeper level of scientific understanding, but anyone can speculate on the regimen’s experiment. That means anyone can bet on the next longevity breakthrough on pump.science.\n## Why is this something people want? \nFinding ground truth data on longevity regimens is hard. Many advocates (marketers) for particular regimens have a financial interest in doing so. It is also commonly argued that longevity is a ‘problem for rich people,’ but time is the most valuable asset for all of us. We want to democratize not only the funding discovery of longevity breakthroughs but also their supporting evidence and products because those should be available to everyone. With pump.science, we hope to create a fair and open system for longevity and a new blueprint for science at large.\nCome play with our worms. It’s the only game that isn’t wasting time - it’s creating it. \n###    \nLet's pump.science\nAre you ready to pump.science?

Whether you are a Web3 native, or just jumping in, Catalyst is for everyone to participate in funding innovative research. This guide will walk you through the steps to start your journey on Catalyst, from connecting your wallet to funding your first project.\n## Step 1: Visit the Catalyst Website\nStart by heading over to [Catalyst](https://catalyst.molecule.xyz/). This is where you'll discover a variety of projects seeking funding. You can explore projects related to longevity, neuroscience, and more.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66c3ad6c5ae35c514e7d87e6_AD_4nXfVQVlzjWtR1jEPB9crBkkhPFIRYo3i4ZA9GmxKpQhTj5Hakr0jSa8xQjekUdhqF8Gqgytxj3JQmAQUsNQnQTJ3PhTiR0ny_7vUyL89v-6o8zxw5duPkybP5cpPootz9IXLqrC2tctjI3XUdy7uBUp5SoA.png)\n## Step 2: Login or Connect Your Wallet\n### Connect Your MetaMask Wallet\nTo participate, you'll need a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) [wallet](https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-a-crypto-wallet). If you don't have one, you can easily set one up by downloading the [MetaMask extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?utm_source=google.com&pli=1) for your browser or the mobile app. If you need additional support, follow [this complete setup guide](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/).\n### Login with Email or Socials\nYou can also choose to log in using your email or social account using Privy. Privy allows you to use Catalyst using just your email. You will be able to fund your wallet in Catalyst through Coinbase Pay or Moonpay.   \n  \nTo fund using Moonpay, click on your wallet in the top right corner, click “Get ETH,” and then click “Moonpay.” You will be taken to Moonpay’s application where you can purchase ETH and fund your wallet. \nOnce your wallet is set up, click the \"Connect\" button at the top of the Catalyst homepage. Follow the prompts to link your MetaMask wallet to the platform.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66c3ad6cd4cfd0211f7f7ff8_AD_4nXd3-S0BDyObhQAK5MALqRrBQKrDyu-AcnjO6yYJArQw2j9T9DzuetaudKB3YLVYVRj0DIKAyxX0ftWf0O5AhK1vJnwcrNURTrGji4tImgVGu1MiiQnQORM4WPo9IPmRdbJLN-c8HkH9bUYWKuYPBdB_1b6C.png)\n## Step 3: Bridge to Base\nCatalyst operates on [Base](https://www.base.org/), a blockchain network optimized for secure and low-cost transactions. To interact with projects on Catalyst, you'll need to [bridge your ETH](https://support.metamask.io/metamask-portfolio/move-crypto/bridge/how-to-use-the-bridge/) from the Ethereum mainnet to Base. This can be done directly within MetaMask or once you have connected your wallet to Catalyst, you can click ‘ Get ETH’ and select the bridging option as shown below. :\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66c3ad6dc49cd97ca8774137_AD_4nXcB2Cc_tjt_-iu-q24oU6AslNlzWc4bGRtK7Kj0SwwOtEeuNVZa4Za1PHc4FOaeokBYiF-5xktvY1bq1Jod0lvm8x-4EAfi3nrP_WJdkrtRCrRGO4Kguh0mSTWIronh-XZkQWbx9Z8GU2rxxzoPAhPSDpi6.png)\n#### If you are briding using Open your MetaMask wallet: \nIn the network dropdown, select \"Base\" or add it as a custom network if it's not listed. Use the bridge option in MetaMask to transfer ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to the Base network.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66c3ad6c681c5da260f0d67d_AD_4nXcvtyujb-RJ1W9lsJgCLGlAMcOhSd--iPzTct4rEMGHa3k72jfF3DzCxIC66v2hmLLAyXf6ddk6l8dlJ8GlgAfhlnI-DH9byemmoK-OLbzwwoCWTE8OKRZ5HN--bxIgawm2dzwUG1oTEE3js2v_YdawQIFr.jpeg)\nOnce your ETH is successfully bridged to Base, you'll be ready to fund projects.\n## Step 4: Find a Project and Fund It\nBrowse through the available projects on Catalyst. When you find a project that aligns with your interests, click on it to learn more. \nTo contribute, simply enter the amount of ETH you want to contribute in the funding section. Confirm the transaction in your MetaMask wallet, and your contribution will be processed.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66c3ad6c54ae6df2030c1049_AD_4nXey7m_k21AA1ehmjodtlY3-5hep9v_NAdgycYou_R0EEDH0oRWcZ6b3q1ejI_AM9BOxmJPg46kX77SfBsvC06PbadSzHPi-KLZ1Xo2IFEiJ9qFJfhlU8wuvCjPc-xQ1Xzd6cjGOi3rBZDhTS7Eh8NDIiEU.png)\n## Step 5: Receive IPTs\nTo receive IP Tokens, the project must reach its funding goal, and a research agreement must be successfully finalized between the researchers and sponsors. If the funding goal isn’t met or an agreement isn’t reached, your funds will be refunded.\nWhen the project’s funding goal is met and a successful negotiation is finalized, you’ll receive your IP Tokens, giving you governance rights over the IP generated by the research you’ve funded.After funding a project, you'll receive IP tokens (IPTs) in return. IPTs represent your share in the intellectual property generated by the research you're funding. \n## You're ready to fund!\nThat's it! You've successfully connected to Catalyst, bridged to Base, and funded a project. By supporting these groundbreaking initiatives, you're not only contributing to scientific progress but also becoming a part of the DeSci community.

Uniting consumers and producers around shared incentives they create value using resources they don’t own or control. They serve communities, and instead of operating on constrained supply economies of a single firm, they unleash network effects between all participants.\nWhile other parts of our economy — retail, travel, hotels, apartments, taxis, banking — have shifted to open data and digital marketplace models over the past decades, biotech and pharma continue to operate on closed pipeline models. This monopolises innovation, slows progress and often results in higher drug prices for patients. In software, the advent of open source development and collaboration models enabled by platforms such as Linux and Github have completely changed how we consume software today. At Molecule, we believe the time is ripe for new digital operating systems and marketplaces to radically accelerate how we bring drugs to patients. Ship faster, cheaper and more diverse treatments, driven by network effects.\nMuch of the sluggishness around innovation is tied to governance issues and lack of coordination in biopharmaceutical innovation systems. Take the current pandemic as an example. Over the past two months, we’ve seen an unprecedented explosion of coronavirus R&D with currently over [60 new COVID19 treatments, vaccines and therapeutics in development](https://www.genengnews.com/virology/coronavirus/catching-up-to-coronavirus-top-60-treatments-in-development/)- a phenomenal achievement. Yet, these efforts remain scattered and siloed among a multitude of big corporations, academic institutions, governments and smaller biotechs. Does it make sense to have all these stakeholders work on the same thing? The industry today is incredibly fragmented. Platform technologies can help create new efficiencies here via coordination, by distributing incentives, value and leveraging smaller stakeholders at different parts of the value chain.\nA great example of this is [Covid Moonshot](https://covid.postera.ai/covid) a non-profit project by an AI-startup called PostEra. The startup combined their AI algorithm with the collective wisdom of the worlds chemist. They asked a global community of medicinal chemists to design new Covid-19 drug candidates [based on early academic work in the UK](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/postera-points-its-synthesis-algorithm-at-coronavirus/4011517.article).\n> _“As of_[ _7 April_](https://discuss.postera.ai/t/round-2-is-finished-now-a-call-for-help/816) _400 contributors had submitted more than 3500 suggestions. As the submissions came in, the company used its algorithms to work out which of these compounds would be easiest to make, most likely to work, and least likely to be toxic. This produced an initial list of 250 compounds, along with recipes for their synthesis. PostEra has sent this information to contract manufacturer_[ _Enamine_](https://enamine.net/about-us) _in Kiev, Ukraine, to create them. On 8 April, the first 100 arrived at the University of Oxford, UK, where researchers will test how well they bind to the protease in the lab.”_\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62471fed4773c57cf932cb53_covid-vaccine-developent-molecule-dao.png)\nCovid Moonshot by PostEra: A few of the over 3,500 submissions for potential novel Covid19 drug candidates.\n## Sharing Economies in Pharma: Intellectual property, data & funding\nSo, Covid-19 is creating enormous pressure to rethink current practices. Over the past months, we saw existing drugs being fast-tracked and research teams from across the globe joining forces to create novel vaccines at breakneck speed. If the right platforms and collaboration tools existed, this approach could be scaled far beyond the current crisis and fundamentally reshape how we discover and develop medicines.\n‍\nSo how are new therapeutics made? From a high-level, it's fairly simple. Pharma consists of 3 core elements:\n  * 👩‍🔬 **New discoveries & IP**\n  * **📈 Data**\n  * 💸**Funding**\n\n\nImagine a global marketplace that was designed to facilitate these types of interactions: a newly discovered molecule is uploaded that shows promise, scientists from across the globe can analyse the data, investors begin funding the promising compound to finance further studies and produce more data. Our team has been working on blockchain-based infrastructure to channel funding mechanisms for over a year. We believe decentralized finance will play a huge role in unleashing the true potential of distributed drug development, but it’s early, and we need to focus on basic marketplace dynamics first.\nHow can a platform approach help with the current pandemic and hunt for a cure? While companies and research institutes announce new ways to tackle Covid-19 by the day, it’s hard to keep track of the new press releases, funding sources and how organisations and individuals can best collaborate. We want to enable people to share their innovations, funding avenues and data more [easily to facilitate these new forms of collaboration](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/world/europe/coronavirus-science-research-cooperation.html?smtyp=cur&smid=fb-nytimes).\nOur early platform empowers scientists **to share their innovations** more easily, **display data** about them in structured ways and make them **discoverable** in a beautiful interface and repository.\nWhy would they do this? To connect with collaborators and funders. While most larger pharma and biotech companies already have ample funding avenues and large R&D teams, especially universities outside of the major innovation hubs (MIT, Stanford, Oxford), which in most cases do not have access to these resources. Our listing helps scientists with 3 things:\n  1. Provides visibility, searchability and more open access to data without the constraints imposed by commercial and intellectual property.\n  2. Easily share their needs, progress and find development and industry partners.\n  3. Enables promising approaches to be quickly identified by funders and accelerated.\n\n\nAt the same time, we’ve seen governments, NGOs, venture capitalists and private companies announce **funding** for Covid-19 treatments at an astonishing rate. More capital is being deployed into vaccine development than ever before. With our system, we want to list these promising funding initiatives to:\n  1. Make them discoverable by the scientists most in need.\n  2. Enable easy access and overview of various funders and their goals.\n\n\nThe final puzzle piece rests with laboratories and contract research organizations (CROs) that have the capacity to perform the tests and trials needed and produce the **data** that ensures that therapeutics are safe and efficacious. For these data producers, our platform allows:\n  1. Scientists to quickly identify suitable partners.\n  2. CROs to find projects they can help with.\n\n\nFor example, we recently [partnered with Arctoris](https://www.labiotech.eu/medical/arctoris-molecule-lab-automation/) — a cloud robotics laboratory where drug discovery data production is automated — to explore these types of use cases. Enabling early-stage researchers to automate pre-clinical experiments around their research and make them discoverable levels the playing field and allows the most promising discoveries to succeed.\nWith these 3 core stakeholders in place, we are creating a global platform and “virtual accelerator” that enables faster and more efficient interactions, transparency and prioritization of the best approaches. While we initially intend to curate projects ourselves, we the platform will be open access and we hope to inspire a community of scientists, funders and CROs to list themselves.\n## What’s Next? Soft Launch.\nWe are currently finalizing the first set of research projects that will go live on our platform. Our first big goal is to help accelerate scientists and early-stage projects out of academia and small biotechs, that are still flying under the radar today. If we want to rapidly find new cures, we need to leave our traditional paradigms and approach this bottom-up. Simultaneously, we are reaching out to funders and CROs to participate in this new ecosystem.\n👩🔬 **Do you have a research project or know someone working on one? We’d love to talk to them!**\n💸 **Interested in funding an early-stage COVID-19 therapeutic, or know someone who is? Please send them our way.**\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/reinventing-pharma-amidst-covid-19-from-siloes-to-ecosystems)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/reinventing-pharma-amidst-covid-19-from-siloes-to-ecosystems)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/reinventing-pharma-amidst-covid-19-from-siloes-to-ecosystems)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

The original three-step process – researchers submitted proof of invention, minted IP-NFTs for onchain ownership, then minted Science IPTs for governance – showed that real-world science IP could be tokenized, governed, and coordinated onchain. \nThe forthcoming Molecule v2 framework represents the evolution of Science IPTs by creating a pathway for token holders to gain equity ownership of the underlying science in a legally compliant framework. Science IPTs will fulfill their promise as Science RWAs, enabling onchain governance and legal IP ownership of scientific discoveries. \nThe Molecule v2 protocol will enable researchers to commercialize onchain science along traditional biotech paths – pharmaceutical acquisitions and licensing deals, like [Prima Donna](https://molecule.xyz/ipts/donna?utm_source=website&utm_id=ipt_blog)'s enamel regeneration technology building toward FDA approval. \nAnd while Science IPTs prepare to get more flexible and more powerful, they’re also becoming more widely available, as Bio Protocol and [pump.science](https://pump.science) now offer new ways to leverage Science IPTs on their platforms.\n## **Bio & pump.science have entered the Science IPT chat**\nGood ideas spread. Life on Earth started in the ocean and spread to land. Science IPTs started trading on Molecule – and have now migrated to Bio Protocol and pump.science.\nThese platforms are contributing new ideas to the Science IPT framework for new use cases. DeSci is evolving. Science IPTs are evolving too. \nBio has introduced AI BioAgents that develop and explore new scientific hypotheses, and use Science IPTs as funding vehicles to funnel value back to the BioAgents, Bio DAOs, and specific research labs. Bio's AI-generated IPTs focus on novel IP discovery, identifying therapeutic targets humans might miss, positioning them for early-stage pharma partnerships.\n[Aubrai](https://aubr.ai/), the BioAgent based on the life’s work of famed longevity researcher [Aubrey de Grey](https://x.com/aubreydegrey), launched in August 2025 and has already generated over 1,100 hypotheses, each a new opportunity to mint a Science IPT. \n[BIOMEAI](https://app.bio.xyz/agents/biomeai), the [MicrobiomeDAO](https://www.microbiomedao.com/) BioAgent, launched last week. Many more BioAgent launches are on the way. More BioAgents mean more hypotheses and more Science IPTs. \nBeyond BioAgents, Bio is launching other Science IPT use cases, like $eDMT, a Science IPT from [PsyDAO](https://x.com/psy_dao) to fund research into therapeutic uses for DMT.\npump.science takes another approach – Science IPTs represent compounds launched on the platform, with trading fees funding research using worms, flies, mice, and soon humans. To date, pump.sciencee has launched markets to explore 73 compounds – each tokenized as a Science IPT. \nWhile compound submission is currently whitelisted, the platform will soon transition to a fully open and permissionless marketplace for scientific research, enabling more compounds, experiments, and Science IPTs. \nBio and pump.science are also innovating new pathways for research on direct-to-consumer products, spanning pain and inflammation, nootropics, and more. Percepta Sport, a nootropic developed by [CerebrumDAO](https://www.cerebrumdao.com), is already available from Molecule’s [DeSci store](https://www.molecule.to/shop), on Amazon, and in stores like Walmart.\nScience is infinitely creative, experimental, flexible, and transformative – Science IPTs are too.\n## **Towards a DeSci Cambrian Explosion**\nMolecule created the original Science IPT framework to bring scientific research and funding onchain – and it worked. Molecule v2 advances that mission by introducing a compliant pathway to offer equity in the underlying IP. \nNow, the Science IPT framework has spread to Bio Protocol, pump.science, and beyond. The framework’s more open and composable next iteration will lead to more use cases, hypotheses, experimental protocols, and pathways to commercialization. \nSoon, a Cambrian explosion of onchain scientific ideas, tokenized as Science IPTs, will unlock the most productive era of scientific discovery in human history. \nBio/acc.\n‍\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/science-ip-tokens-acc)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/science-ip-tokens-acc)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/science-ip-tokens-acc)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Prior to Molecule, his team had been using machine learning to analyze the medical records of 4 million Danish citizens, identifying prescription drugs associated with longer lifespans. Funding was needed to perform wet-lab testing on the possible candidates, and that’s where [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/) came in. By purchasing the intellectual property-NFT, this DAO, whose mission is to improve human lifespan and healthspan, was able to meet the funding goal of $250 000. Dr Scheibye-Knudsen and his team are currently testing compounds in both fruit fly and human cell models, with a reduction in cellular senescence being used as a measure of success. At the six-month review, the team had been able to rule out one compound as it had not been fruitful in the fly model. They had also identified a promising new compound that was showing consistent reduction in cellular senescence. Moreover, new avenues of research may be opened up through this study — the mechanism through which these molecules act will need to be characterized. There is still a vast library of prescription medications that could be tested, each representing a possible treatment for aging. Imagine being able to wake up and take a longevity compound cocktail each morning! Dr Scheibye-Knudsen has recently published a [paper on cellular senescence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00263-3), and if you look closely, you’ll be able to spot VitaDAO in the acknowledgements.\n> “ _In my core (I) believe that leveraging the community for scientific development is exciting and useful. I think we need as many minds as possible to work on these problems.”_\n_Dr Morten Scheibye-Knudsen_\n### **Dr Korolchuk & Autophagy Activators**\nAging is associated with defective autophagy pathways in cells. The process is as follows: faulty autophagy leads to an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and other cellular components such as protein aggregates, which in turn cause stress pathways to be activated. These pathways deplete cellular resources to the point of eventual apoptosis, or cell suicide. One of the key reasons for defective autophagy is lysosomal dysfunction which sits right at the finish line of the autophagy process, and is Dr Viktor Korolchuk’s area of interest. Having identified possible autophagy activators, Dr Korolchuk contacted Molecule to find funding to test these activators. [Within four weeks his project was assessed by VitaDAO and approved](https://from.ncl.ac.uk/funding-science-through-blockchain-technology-and-cryptocurrencies). Not only was this thrilling, but it represented the huge strides being made by Molecule to increase the ease in which projects are funded. Using Npc1 knockout cells, which are unable to form lysosomal protein and thus complete autophagy, Dr Korolchuk will administer potential activators to these cells. These compounds will also be tested against cells that lack the ability to initiate autophagy, to demonstrate the specificity of these activators to work at the terminal stage of autophagy which involves the lysosome. According to Dr Korolchuk, two of the most beneficial aspects of receiving funding through a DAO are the possibilities of collaboration and/or data sharing within the VitaDAO community. \n### **Dr Fang & Mitophagy Activators**\n“A sharp body makes a sharp mind” is the sentiment of Dr Evandro Fei Fang. A trailblazer in his field, Dr Fang was the first to propose mitophagy, a subtype of autophagy, as a possible driver for Alzheimer's, and went on to demonstrate its causative role in the disease _._ Using AI, aptly named Fang-AI, his lab has identified compounds that may activate mitophagy. With the support of VitaDAO, other novel small molecule libraries will also be tested in Fang-AI. VitaDAO is facilitating the testing of these compounds, with Dr Fang citing the delicate nature of cell toxicity as a probable hurdle. These compounds will be tested cross-species in order to reduce the chance of false positives. If they are successful, drug therapies could be developed to treat not only patients with Alzheimer's but people suffering from all sorts of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and ALS. Within this grant, Fang’s previous PhD student, Dr Shuqin Cao, has also received funding. During Dr Cao’s PhD, she identified two mitophagy activators in passion fruit which, amazingly, were effective at one tenth of the dose of the small molecules identified by Fang-AI. VitaDAO’s funding will allow for further structural modification to patent these molecules.\n> _“Assigning an intellectual property agreement to VitaDAO allowed us to concentrate on the wet lab. They talk to industry to see who is willing to buy the IP, or do clinical trials. This is a win-win for both parties.”_\n_Dr Evandro Fei Fang_\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/646def4f7bf192cebd02ea64_3f8d77e1.png)\n_Dr Fang and his team hard at work_\n### **Dr An & Periodontal Disease**\nPeriodontitis, a chronic oral disease, is the inflammaging (inflammation without overt infection) of the tissues supporting our teeth. This leads to the degradation of connective tissue, bone, and eventual loss of the tooth. It is inextricably linked with aging and is not only painful _,_ but also associated with age related diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's. Dr An, a self described “dentist scientist”, is crafting the first medical non-surgical solution to this problem. This project is the first project to be funded as an IP-NFT in the US. Previously Dr An had found that the drug Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, had had success in reducing age-related periodontal bone loss in mice. Based on those studies, his team will use funding from VitaDAO to test small molecule inhibitors of the mTOR pathway to combat this inflammaging. At the end of the eight week study in mouse models the aim is to see a reduction in inflammaging or even a direct improvement of periodontal disease. Although the study is examining dental disease the benefit extends further, as a prospective method to ward off many cognition- and age-related diseases. As a patient, the hope is that one day the toothpaste from your local grocery store will contain these small molecules, stopping periodontitis before it even begins. \n### **Dr Sharma & Senolytic CAR-NK Cells **\nMethods to clear senescent cells have been already established, but come with the caveat of potentially deleterious off-target effects. By harnessing our own immune system, we could mitigate the damaging effect of these senescent cells, while avoiding unfortunate side effects. Dr Sharma proposed that Chimeric Antigen Receptor Natural Killer cells (CAR-NK) could be the answer, based on the [success of CAR-T](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00121-8) cells to combat cancer. Natural killer cells, our immune system’s surveillance team, are cheaper to produce and have the benefit of not needing to be derived from the individual patient, compared to T cells. Additionally, natural killer cells are cleared from the body in 2–3 weeks, which reduces the potential of off-target effects. Senescent cells have unique surface markers, three of which have been characterized by Dr Sharma’s team. VitaDAO is funding the design of natural killer cells that will recognise these markers. Dr Sharma’s research sits on the threshold of a wide range of further study; senescent cells are heterogenous, meaning that this method may not work ubiquitously. Additionally, some senescent cells are beneficial, and thus should not be a target. A resounding principle of the DeSci movement is to look at science through a different lens: one of intrigue and development rather than the pressure to report immediately actable results. VitaDAO saw the intrinsic value in this research for those reasons.\n### **Dr Paus & Thyroid Hormones for Hair Loss**\nHair loss is commonly considered a cosmetic issue but affects the majority of the population in their lifetime, and can cause great emotional distress. This is the cause that drives [HairDAO](https://www.hairdao.xyz/), the second DAO to enter the IP-NFT arena. Leading their first project is Dr Ralf Paus, a titan in the hair loss field. Previously, Dr Paus had established that the introduction of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 was able to extend the hair follicle growth phase, stimulate keratin production, as well as mitigate hair cell apoptosis. This was done by adding thyroid hormones into organ culture, in which the hair follicles sat. Before Dr Paus, topical thyroid hormones had never been tested in the context of dermatology. Funding from HairDAO will allow Dr Paus to test T3 and T4 on human scalp skin, with a possible second bout of funding to further the research. Results are expected summertime this year. Fascinatingly, one of the drawbacks in hair loss research is model validity. Mouse hair models do not adequately emulate human hair models… so if anyone is willing to donate a bit of your scalp, let him know! A self-described luddite, Dr Paus was apprehensive of this reasonably tech savvy way of funding but guidance from HairDAO and Molecule made the process painless. He later went on to speak to one of the key advantages of being funded by a DAO: having a community of people who share your vision and can offer robust scientific commentary. \n![Dr Paus working on a previous study](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/646def4f61f77e68c1a29b03_887be873.png)\n_Dr Paus working on a previous study_\n### **Looking to the horizon…**\nHot on the heels of HairDAO is [ValleyDAO](https://www.valleydao.bio/). The DAO, whose focus is synthetic biology, is in talks with Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro to fund his research into lipid extraction from oleaginous yeast. While microbial lipids are far more sustainable than the alternatives; sources of animal fats and plant oils - they are more expensive to extract. Dr Ledesma-Amaro aims to combat this. [AthenaDAO](https://www.athenadao.co/) also has a potential IP-NFT in the pipeline, tackling ovarian aging with PhD student, Lu Dong. On the surface, female reproductive health seems to only pertain to women, but AthenaDAO reminds us that this issue matters to every person because it impacts the creation of a future generation. Outside of the umbrella of IP-NFT’s, the ever-active VitaDAO has a couple of projects on the horizon. They have funded the creation of [_The Longevist_](https://twitter.com/longevist_xyz), a careful curation of longevity research, to be released every quarter. You can expect the first issue soon! \nExperimentation is integral to scientific progression — and that extends to all aspects of the scientific process. We’d like to express our gratitude to these six researchers and their teams for embracing change and experimenting with this novel way of funding.

Commercialization leads to revenue, which creates opportunities for projects to return value to token holders who originally funded the project, encouraging further research.\nAs [CerebrumDAO](https://www.cerebrumdao.com/), [pump.science](https://pump.science/)'s 73+ compounds, and [Bio Protocol](https://www.bio.xyz/)'s AI-generated hypotheses progress toward commercialization, each success story demonstrates that supporting early-stage research can generate real returns.\nThis is the DeSci value flywheel – complete economic cycles where scientific breakthroughs fuel the next generation of discoveries, with value flowing back to those who believed from the beginning.\n## The DeSci value distribution toolkit\nDeSci projects have a variety of unique mechanisms they can choose from to drive value for token holders.\n**Royalty tokens** allow projects to tokenize revenue streams from licensing agreements. When a project licenses its IP for development, the project can tokenize those royalty streams into royalty tokens – digital representations of contractual rights to revenue percentages. These tokens can be airdropped to IPT holders who are members of the project or offered at preferential rates to them, sharing partnership income.\n**Token-to-equity pathways** allow IPT holders to lock their tokens, complete an identity verification (“Know Your Customer” or “KYC”) process, and request to participate in the actual equity in a project's corporate entity in exchange for their governance work. Once token holders complete this process, they become shareholders with full economic rights, creating a spectrum of participation – casual holders can stay liquid with tokens, while committed contributors can become company shareholders. \n**Rights offerings for future funding rounds** offer IPT holders another potential value mechanism. When projects raise funds from outside investors like venture capitalists, qualified token holders can get preferential access to purchase equity alongside VCs. This is a great opportunity for individual investors who made early commitments to the project to participate with institutional investors that may join the project later.\n**Spinoff compound NFTs** offer early investors the opportunity to participate in secondary projects. When one line of research produces alternative applications, these derivative research projects can be tokenized as separate NFTs and offered first to qualified IPT holders. So, similar to how Bored Ape NFT holders were once given the first opportunity to mint Mutant Ape NFTs, early investors in a promising Alzheimer's research might also gain early access to invest in a spin-off brain health supplement.\n## The Sustainable DeSci Economy\nThese mechanisms – including royalty tokens, equity, rights offerings, and spinoff NFTs – create a comprehensive DeSci value distribution toolkit. Token-based value distribution from product sales completes the loop in DeSci economics: research funded by communities, developed into products, generating revenue that returns to supporters through multiple pathways. It's a model making decentralized science economically sustainable, where every successful product strengthens the incentive to fund the next breakthrough.\nThis is the DeSci value flywheel, and it’s accelerating.\n‍\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-desci-value-flywheel)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-desci-value-flywheel)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-desci-value-flywheel)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

Eroom's law (Moore’s Law, in reverse) is the observation that drug discovery is becoming slower and more expensive over time, despite improvements in technology. While technologies such as high-throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, and computational drug design should have arguably improved the rate of innovation, progress has been bottlenecked by other systemic and institutional-level issues such as increasing regulatory burden, a lack of open-source sharing of technologies, and misallocation of capital in incumbents that have prevented new drugs from reaching the market, and therefore, patients.\n‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62443cbfe0e234c54befcdf6_1_MuA8T97GCzbHKyABgtbfdw.png)\n‍\nOne potential explanation for this trend is the failure of coordination of capital and resources, coupled with monopolistic intellectual property models that pervade pharma and biotech at scale. These models disincentivize information sharing and collaboration, muddling data production and generating ambivalence on experimental outcomes. While new laboratory technologies alone have failed to improve efficiency in drug development, we believe that new advances in network, coordination, and incentive technologies at a structural level could reverse this trend by enabling new methods of optimizing collaboration, talent, and capital allocation.\nBiotechnology and pharma have been historically centralized in the form of large companies and organizations that lack incentive to work in open and collaborative ways. Put differently, pharma has a “closed source” culture. The decentralization trend is dethroning centralized entities with power monopolies and shifting towards networks of collaborators co-existing in flat hierarchies.\nDecentralized communities are powered by sharing pre-competitive resources within a community to achieve a common goal. They promote an open-source culture to their members and incentivize them to collaborate using token-based mechanisms.\nDecentralized networks provide a trustless environment where data reconciliation is improved, points of weakness are reduced, and resource distribution is optimized at scale. In the context of biotech, this means creating new organizational structures that have a low barrier to entry (logging onto Discord, for example), are intrinsically collaborative and incentive aligned (WAGMI), and can coordinate capital and work from any participant (even the general public and patients). These features are emerging in the form of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\nDAOs are relatively new smart contract-based entities that enable the coordination of capital, talent, and crowd intelligence at an unprecedented scale. Recently, a new decentralized science (DeSci) movement has been rapidly changing the way that coordination in science and biotech occurs by leveraging DAOs (see [VitaDAO](https://vitadao.com/), [PsyDAO](https://www.psydao.io/), [labDAO](https://www.labdao.com/)), with [Molecule](https://www.molecule.to/) increasingly positioned as a core infrastructure provider in the space.\nThe DeSci movement is currently forming as a talent pool for entrepreneurial researchers and leading thinkers in biotech innovation that are frustrated by the status quo, whether it relates to funding, coordination, collaboration or other systemic issues that affect young founders and academics in biotechnology. The NIH, for example, allocates just 2% of its funding to scientists under 36, and 98% to those 36 and older. This trend, amongst others, has led to enough frustration that several new organizational types, such as FROs and DAOs, have emerged with an intention to revolutionize the biotech landscape. But what exactly is a DAO? Why is it important, and how might it change biotech?\n### The Biotech DAO Design Space\nLet’s begin to understand biotech DAOs by walking through the steps of creating a DAO and how they function. An appropriate starting point for a biotech DAO is a clear vision and mission — what do these new, open organizational frameworks enable? Biotech DAOs can coordinate talent, enable decentralized fundraising and governance, or help create standardized methods of data collection and production, among other things. They can be philanthropic or for-profit. While biotech DAOs have a limitless design space their key innovation is their lack of gate-keeping and the use of technology to mediate decisions by large communities.\nOne element that all biotech DAOs have in common: they address a problem that has so far been unsolvable given the lack of incentive mechanisms for widespread collaboration in biotech.\nTo better understand this, we can take an example — VitaDAO, the first biotech DAO birthed by Molecule. VitaDAO is focused on funding early-stage preclinical drug development in the context of longevity. When designing VitaDAO, Molecule’s goal was to 3-fold:\n  1. Create a Schelling point and community building exercise at the intersection of longevity and Web3, enabling researchers and the public to gather and participate in research and funding.\n  2. Fund cutting edge, high impact research out of academia, and help to translate this research into effective medicines\n  3. Create a sustainable organization as a function of its commercial efforts, with proceeds from these efforts providing a continuous funding mechanism for longevity science.\n\n\nThe third point, “a sustainable organization as a function of its commercial efforts” requires that the DAO derives monetary value from its funding efforts. To do this, VitaDAO leverages Molecule’s [IP-NFT](https://medium.com/molecule-blog/molecules-biopharma-ipnfts-a-technical-description-4dcfc6bf77f8) framework, which allows the DAO to own, license, and transact in intellectual property generated from the projects it supports. VitaDAO works to fund and later commercialize early-stage research out of academia. The DAO owns the resulting IP from the projects it funds. **For the first time, value is captured by large, decentralized communities of researchers and patients.**\n‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62443d2d07e5781ddcdd8d12_0_GsxpburGrKyS6Hls.png)\n‍\nNFTs can enable us to capture all sorts of asset types, including IP rights and data, and manage them natively in web3. Web3 allows these assets to exist in cyberspace, which means you can interact with them in some way no matter which country you’re in, transcending borders, time zones and jurisdictions. This is a big step in democratizing access to these assets. NFTs can be transferred to another wallet, tokenized, collateralized and borrowed against, sold on NFT marketplaces and they can be programmed so that the original creator automatically receives royalties every time the NFT is resold.\nAt Molecule, pioneering novel frameworks for IP-NFTs that attach both IP and data to NFTs turns IP into a new highly liquid, transactable asset class that bridges web3 into the real-world. Designs here are early, and these new vehicles will need to stand the test of time and the courts. Early data shows they work and comply.\n### BioDAO Frameworks\nVitaDAO is the first design of what a biotech DAO might look like. One of the core goals at Molecule is to create productized biotech DAO frameworks that enable anyone to build their own biotech DAO, operationalize it, and begin leveraging the effects of a large, open community to achieve their goals. To this end, Molecule is seeking to work with motivated researchers, patient groups, entrepreneurs, community builders and visionaries that are interested in building at the intersection of biotech x web3.\nWe imagine these structures becoming instrumental in shaping patient and researcher communities. Imagine patient- and researcher-centric Bio DAOs focused on Alzheimer’s research, specific types of cancers, or diabetes with tight feedback loops and collaboration between patients and researchers during the entire end-to-end drug development process, from funding to licensing and beyond.\nAt Molecule, we see our core responsibilities here to help builders in a number of ways:\n  1. Enable biotech DAO builders to leverage our IP-NFT legal licensing frameworks and DAO organizational frameworks. We will support their efforts of collaborating with and supporting academics via Molecule’s marketplace.\n  2. Funding from the right sources. We will provide liquidity and support to projects in the form of grants and token swaps. WAGMI.\n  3. Provide a talent pool that can move between DAOs, helping build and bootstrap across all components of a DAO: treasury, governance, operations, strategy, marketing, education, and search/evaluation. We have a network of researchers, entrepreneurs, builders, biotech VCs, and enthusiasts to help build the best organizations possible.\n  4. Help establish sound global legal frameworks tailored to specific biotech and patient-centric DAO communities such as for-profit LAO like frameworks pioneered by Tribute Labs or non-profit Swiss Associations.\n\n\nPsyDAO will be the second biotech DAO that Molecule launches and its ultimate goal is to democratize access to psychedelics. We aim to achieve this core goal through several related means. The first is by bringing together a large community of researchers, KOLs, enthusiasts, and spiritual leaders to collaborate and determine the future of psychedelic research. Collectively, this group will work on funding psychedelic research in exchange for ownership in intellectual property, which will be open-sourced and made available to all or commercialized. A key goal is working to make psychedelic IP unmonopolizable by front-running industry or purchasing IP to be made public, before it is patented. This design principle differs slightly from VitaDAO’s, for example.\nOthers in the ecosystem are also beginning to build biotech DAOs with entirely different functions, going beyond funding. One leading example here is LabDAO. LabDAO is building a community-owned and operated platform to run scientific laboratory services, exchange protocols, and share data. These organizations have a high potential for interoperation and collaboration.\nYou can imagine a scenario where organizations like VitaDAO source assets from Molecule’s [Discovery Marketplace](http://discover.molecule.to/) in the form of IP-NFTs. VitaDAO funds early preclinical de-risking experiments. Once positive data emerges, and new experiments need to be performed that might be beyond the scope of the laboratory receiving funding, LabDAO — a community of laboratories — steps in, coordinating downstream development work and experimentation via other academic labs and CROs. Decentralized drug development begins to take shape. Further, the IP-NFT allows different contributors (like LabDAO members) to receive exposure to ownership in IP, in exchange for work. These organizations begin to form a modular, decentralized drug development pipeline with each organization playing to its strengths, and receiving rewards for their contributions.\nAll of these parts taken together begin to form the basis of a collaborative, open, and inclusive ecosystem that has the potential to permeate and shift monopolistic behavior in biotech towards something that is more strongly aligned with patient and researcher’s interests. This is the beginning of a new frontier for biotech, and this is only Day 1.\nPlease join us in helping build a better future for biotech.\n### An open BIO ecosystem for humanity\nWe want to help anyone that shares our dream of an open pharmaceutical system.

One of the most significant criticisms is the centralization of funding and knowledge, often exemplified by new publications and research locked behind the paywalls. However, what if there was a way to change this? A way to break down these barriers and open the field to a more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative approach? \nFor us at Molecule, and for many others in the community, Decentralized Science (DeSci) represents a revolutionary way to tackle these challenges and change science for the better. By utilizing key technological advancements created by blockchain technology, such as NFTs, fungible tokens, and DAOs, DeSci could be exactly the transformative new way of conducting science that we have all been waiting for. However, as with any new paradigm, the success of DeSci requires a clear understanding of what it is about. \nAs a long-time crypto enthusiast with a background in medicine and biology, DeSci has quickly become my primary focus of interest. The potential to accelerate scientific progress and improve the translation of research into practical applications has sparked my interest. However, as a researcher, I noticed that DeSci, as an emerging field, lacks the foundational research necessary to establish common ground in discussions within both academia and the broader community. To address this gap, I conducted research recently published in Frontiers in Blockchain. This post provides a brief summary of my publication, which you can read in full [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/blockchain/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2024.1375763/full).\n‍\n### **Defining Decentralized Science**\nUp until now, the following definition from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/desci/) has been widely used:\n> _“Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack.”_\nAlthough this definition has served the community well, it may no longer fully capture the latest advancements in DeSci. Moreover, it suffers from inconsistencies in defining Web3 and the ‘Web3 stack.’ Therefore, a new definition was proposed based on an extensive literature review and expert survey:\n> _Decentralized Science (DeSci) represents a collaborative and decentralized approach to science, leveraging technological and infrastructural advancements such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), Web3, cryptocurrencies, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to enable permissionless, open, and inclusive participation, facilitating collective governance, equitable incentivization, unrestricted access, shared ownership, and transparent funding of the scientific process._\nThis definition aims to provide the necessary granularity and clarity, not only for current DeSci ecosystem participants, but also to foster discourse within traditional academia, thereby increasing participation and advancing DeSci. \nJust as finding common ground in terminology is crucial for advancing the ecosystem, establishing shared values and principles is vital for the credibility of any new movement, particularly in science. \nAlthough closely related, values and principles serve distinct roles. Values can be considered more abstract, core beliefs that define what is important, while principles are practical guidelines that help ensure that those values are upheld. In the context of DeSci, shared values provide foundational ethos, and guiding principles offer actionable tenets to advance science and address existing challenges.\nGiven the scarcity of publications focusing on the values or principles of DeSci, input from experts in the field was used to propose the following set of shared values and guiding principles for DeSci: \n‍\n### **The Shared Values of DeSci**\nThese shared values form the foundation of the guiding principles of DeSci, which are proposed as practical guidelines to uphold these values and help guide the advancement of science.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66cf2740a14d40f12a0ef771_66cf26b08a70af48dce9a70e_Screenshot%25202024-08-28%2520at%252015.31.15.png)\n‍\n### **The Guiding Values of DeSci**\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/66cf2740a14d40f12a0ef76e_66cf27324386502e25771c3b_Screenshot%25202024-08-28%2520at%252015.33.27.png)\nThe proposed guiding principles of DeSci can also be considered recommendations for how the decentralization of science can be advanced and how new organizations in DeSci can potentially be built. \nThese guiding principles can also be seen as recommendations for advancing the decentralization of science and building new organizations within the DeSci ecosystem. \nFor instance, by providing incentives for contributions of any kind (e.g., peer review, participation in working groups), collaboration within the community can be facilitated, potentially making DeSci competitive with traditional academia. Collective ownership is also a key differentiator from movements such as open science, where openness and transparency are prioritized but with fewer technological means to enforce these values. If collective ownership can be ensured through technologies such as DLT, researchers may be more inclined to share their work, early ideas, or intellectual property more openly. \n‍\n### **A Call for Contribution**\nWhile the proposed shared values and guiding principles can potentially help advance the decentralization of science, broader awareness and participation are needed to address the pain points of traditional science.

We see AI and large language models (LLMs) as a natural extension of this mission.\nWe’re happy to share with you [MIRA v0](https://mira.molecule.xyz/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_id=mira_launch), the release of a large language model developed to support researchers and newcomers to DeSci. MIRA v0 can answer questions related to DeSci & Molecule Products.   \n  \nWith MIRA, you can learn how to register your ideas on chain with Proof-of-Invention, mint your research project into IP-NFTs, explore tools available to fund your research, discover successful projects in the space and track the progress they’re making with their research. \nThe answers are based on curated, audited and carefully written content. This first version represents both a technical and a learning step in how AI can be applied meaningfully within DeSci and Molecule Products.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/687f76b7333be3f53cc02245_Screenshot%202025-07-22%20at%2012.51.20.png)\n### Integrating AI into our tech stack\nThe choice to build MIRA was instinctive - there is no doubt in our minds that AI will significantly accelerate the pace of science. Naturally, our first step was defining a solid foundation on which our team, and others, can build meaningful AI tooling. \nUnlike general-purpose LLMs that use information from across the web, MIRA works within a defined, trusted set of live sources. One of our key design choices with MIRA was teaching it to recognize its limits. We spent some time iterating our base prompt, so the model avoids guessing when it lacks the right information. Instead of hallucinating answers, it redirects you to our domain experts. This reflects our belief that responsible AI should balance automation with human oversight. \nTo ensure high-quality responses, every answer links back to its original source, and we continuously evaluate MIRA’s performance through Langfuse. You can visit [our Github](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/mira-ai-prototype-v0) for more. \n### What we’ve learned already\n  * MIRA v0 confirms that specialized, scoped AI models can help lower the barrier of entry to DeSci. \n  * Researchers can benefit not only from accurate answers, but also from understanding where those answers come from and when the system simply doesn’t know. \n  * We’ve also learned that conversational interfaces provide an accessible, familiar way to engage with DeSci and explore Molecule’s products.  \n‍\n\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/687f76171b015496d44572fb_Screenshot%202025-07-22%20at%2012.51.08.png)\n### What's next?\nWe aim to evolve MIRA. We're exploring how AI systems, in their many forms, can serve researchers, patients, and decentralized science communities. Our goal is to understand how more advanced AI models can meaningfully contribute to our broader vision for DeSci. \nWe are exploring how can AI - particularly agents - can enhance reasoning, signal detection, decision making and make more efficient complex workflows.\n  * **Effective workflows** can be improved by automating complex, fragmented processes in science, tradings, and IP tokenization. We’re beginning to explore agentic workflows to help coordinate actions and support decision-making.  \n\n  * **Augmenting human reasoning** , pattern recognition, and decision-making in high-stakes, data-rich environments like scientific discovery and trading.\n\n\nAs part of this evolution, we’ll be integrating the next iterations of MIRA into our core products, the **Molecule** **Screener** and **Molecule Labs** , to test how it can create value for researchers and funders. \n### Use MIRA today\nAI and LLMs are rapidly transforming the fabric of science, research, and innovation as we know it. This doesn't happen in a vaccum. We'd like you to get involved; have a conversation with MIRA to learn more about the DeSci ecosystem, the Molecule product suite and more. \n_Maria Sanmartín is a Senior Product Manager at Molecule.

It is safe to say that humanity’s course has been altered, but the extent to which will be determined by our actions today and tomorrow. COVID-19 is here to stay, and the important thing now is that we act rapidly to address the key healthcare and economic challenges posed by this disease.\nIn response to this challenge, [science and industry is changing rapidly](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/world/europe/coronavirus-science-research-cooperation.html). These changes are affecting how stakeholders share information, receive funding, and collaborate. There is an unprecedented influx of resources in the form of funding and information from both public and private sources, all of which is actively trying to stimulate innovation in the therapeutic space to combat COVID-19.\nScientists around the world, from universities, drug companies, and startups, are making an unprecedented effort to rapidly develop new medicines with these resources, and in doing so, are having a direct impact on the way that science is conducted. In only two months, many medicines have emerged as potentially useful in treating COVID-19, most of which are pre-existing medicines for other indications that could be repurposed. In some cases, clinical trials are well-underway, and you can find a list of several of the most promising efforts [here](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/19/an-updated-guide-to-the-coronavirus-drugs-and-vaccines-in-development/). As we are working on extremely abbreviated timelines, much of this research is too early to be able to draw meaningful conclusions from — most trials are relatively small and often lack control groups, making much of the emerging data largely anecdotal, but still vital in times of urgency.\n## Science and Publishing are Changing\nAs time is of the essence, accelerated publishing has emerged as an important trend for the quick dissemination of information during this pandemic. This has been extremely useful for sharing timely information, but also poses an immense challenge with respect to quality control. Much of the information being shared is not vetted or peer reviewed before others have access. Scientific progress relies on the effective transmission of high quality research data, which in turn, enable discoveries to be made. We must create innovative ways to achieve a level of quality control with this data. Perhaps we could crowd-source or distribute the effort with many scientists around the world currently working from home.\nThe conversation around publishing used to be concerned with pay-for-access vs. open-access, yet the most relevant players at the moment appear to be pre-print servers, such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), which have emerged as a key way to share early information during this pandemic. However, the abbreviated timelines on which we are receiving information comes, again, at the cost of peer review. All of these recent developments concerning research methodologies and information sharing around COVID-19 are unfolding as [Open Science principles](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/open-science-basics/open-concepts-and-principles) become increasingly mainstream.\nOpen Science aims to share information in real time and free of charge to users by providing free and open access to scientific data. In the case of SARS, it took [roughly 20 months from the point of getting the first genomic insights into the virus to the first vaccine trials in humans](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2759815); however, at that time, only basic sharing infrastructure existed and open science was in its infancy. Today, with respect to COVID-19, we are seeing scientists sharing their data at a rapid pace in real time, coupled with unity in the scientific community. Scientific publishers, typically accessed via paywalls, such as Wiley, Nature, and Elsevier, have all dropped them and signed the [Wellcome Trust’s pledge to share research data and findings relevant to COVID-19](https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data), effectively becoming, at least temporarily, open-access by nature. These changes are temporary and in response to the ongoing pandemic, however, I believe it is likely that many will realise the inherent value of working this way, and it will be difficult to go back to “pre-covid” ways of restricting access to information. The public must rally and call for collaboration and open access to remain.\n## The State of Therapeutics Development for COVID-19\n![molecule-dao-and-ageing-longevity](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/6247250eeb7162d12d94aa23_drug-repurposing-covid-19-molecule-dao.jpeg)\n‍\n## _The Case for Repurposing_\nNormally, it takes [10–12 years to develop a therapeutic from scratch](http://phrma-docs.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/rd_brochure_022307.pdf). Thus, in such times of crisis, it is important to find faster ways to develop therapies. Rather than developing and testing compounds from scratch, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others want to repurpose drugs that are already approved for other indications and have acceptable safety profiles. They are also trying to identify experimental drugs that have performed well in animal studies against the other two deadly coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS. Furthermore, they are focusing primarily on compounds that are broadly available enough to treat a substantial number of patients globally. The WHO has singled out a few key therapies that may hold substantial promise against COVID-19 — an antiviral called [**remdesivir**](https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/clinical_trial_of_gileads_coronavirus_hopeful_remdesivir_begins_in_uk_1334307); the antimalarial [**chloroquine**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-chloroquine-treat-coronavirus/) (as well as [**hydroxychloroquine**](https://time.com/5808894/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus/)); aa combination of HIV drugs, [**lopinavir** and **ritonavir**](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282); and that combination plus **interferon-beta** , an immune system messenger that can help stop viral spread. Each of these treatments would potentially impact the virus via a different mechanism, and each has perks and drawbacks.\nRemdesivir, which was initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and related viruses, works by inhibiting a key viral enzyme required for viral replication, RNA polymerase. While the drug was actually unsuccessful in treating ebola patients during the 2019 outbreak in the DRC, it had been shown previously to inhibit SARS and MERS viruses in both test tube and animal studies. The drug has now been given to hundreds of COVID-19 patients in the US and Europe under the “compassionate use” clause, and some doctors have reported anecdotal evidence of benefit, but without real data. Like many drugs that treat acute infections, Remdesivir may be most effective if given early, and this could be particularly challenging in the case of the novel coronavirus, where many individuals are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms.\nData indicating the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients remains unreliable. Chinese researchers ran an i[nformal study to treat 100 patients with chloroquine and touted its benefit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074550) in _Biosciece_ , but they did not publish their data. In fact, no data has been shared from the more than 20 other COVID-19 studies in China that have used one of the drugs. A french microbiologist, [Didier Raoult, published a study of hydroxychloroquine](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/927758) that suggested that the drug had reduced the viral load in nasal swabs of 20 patients, and this result was improved when given with azithromycin, but the trial was not controlled and didn’t include patients with certain clinical outcomes. It is possible that hydroxychloroquine may actually be more dangerous than beneficial, as it may harm the heart, which could introduce more severe complications relating to COVID-19. Doctors are scrambling to learn if [SARS-CoV-2 may be able to attack the heart](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heart-damage-in-covid-19-patients-puzzles-doctors/), given the appearance of heart damage in patients.\nThe results on lopinavir and ritonavir in combination have been mixed, and in [first small-scale trials,](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282) have not demonstrated efficacy compared to standard care, but additional studies are warranted to determine if the combination could be effective in individuals with severe disease.\nOther experimental therapeutics will be available soon, such as drugs that reduce inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis treatments. Crucially, there is a need to find therapeutics that prevent the disease from advancing to its most severe stages. This could, theoretically, come even before a vaccine if pre-existing therapeutics are effectively repurposed.\n## The Search for a Vaccine\nRoughly 60 companies and academic institutions are currently racing to develop vaccines against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The first of these — produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna — [will enter human trials imminently](https://time.com/5790545/first-covid-19-vaccine/). On the academic front, Researchers at the University of Oxford in the UK have commenced enrolment of healthy volunteers for a clinical trial of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The vaccine is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It is currently in production at the university’s Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility and is expected to be ready in the coming weeks. The trial is designed to enrol up to 510 participants aged 18 to 55 and is being conducted by the university’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group. Many other universities around the world are also working on a vaccine, albeit many are earlier in their developmental stages.\nThe unprecedented speed with which universities and companies are moving to develop a vaccine is thanks largely to early [Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-Cov-2](https://www.asianscientist.com/2020/02/topnews/china-coronavirus-covid-19-study/), allowing research groups globally to grow the live virus and better understand its mechanism of action. Beyond this, vaccinologists have long been hedging their bets by working on prototype pathogens that might bear similarities to viruses likely to cause a global pandemic, if one were to emerge. Thus, current progress builds on an ongoing historical effort to develop vaccines broadly for coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, as well as other related illnesses. [Sars-Cov-2 shares 80–90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused SARS](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\\(20\\)30251-8/fulltext), thus, efforts to develop a vaccine for SARS may be able to be repurposed to effectively combat the current outbreak.\n## The Path Forward — A Unique Opportunity\nWe are entering a unique time in human history — one that requires an unprecedented level of cooperation and collaboration to effectively overcome the broad-scale health and economic challenges being faced by our world. Now more than ever, the sharing of data and a spirit of collaboration are playing a vital role in ensuring that humanity can quickly combat this deadly disease. Once this challenge is overcome, will the world return to business as usual or will we learn from our mistakes and opt for a more open, transparent, and collaborative future? We at [Molecule](http://molecule.to/) challenge the scientific community to continue to promote Open Science principles and collaborate globally to overcome the greatest healthcare challenges of our time. Together, we can use this opportunity to reshape our world for the benefit of humanity.\n[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c546b1db20f73c16e62a6_twitter.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-science-publishing-and-drug-development)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-science-publishing-and-drug-development)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/623c54a3040b3c38729d705b_linkein.svg)](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-science-publishing-and-drug-development)\n[![“twitter-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9beac3569237f4d45_twitter-blog.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet \"Tweet\") [ ![“facebook-icon\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9c3e7fb0b56a00b6d_fb-blog.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t= \"Share on Facebook\") [![linkedin-icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b9878fd25a93c4342c_linkedin-blog.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&title=&summary=&source= \"Share on LinkedIn\") ![“share-link\"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0/624599b922b7c638879d2c4b_link-blog.svg)\n",

It provides a **timestamped, verifiable proof of creation** , establishing indisputable evidence of an invention from the moment of its conception.\nWith PoI, inventors can:\n  * Secure their intellectual property **instantly and affordably** —cheaper than filing a provisional patent or even mailing a letter to themselves.\n  * **Anchor proof on any public ledger** , eliminating the need for expensive and complex traditional IP processes.\n  * Lay the foundation for **seamless IP management** , including the potential to mint IP-NFTs and tokenize their inventions into IPTs.\n  * Maintain complete **portability at no additional cost** , crossing geographical barriers in ways traditional systems cannot.\n\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/67b5f41deb355c5824a646e1_AD_4nXcC7F6oKo1IHgxPDm5e9SDfNTwR-3ikdtqQ0G8NcqHi8VCJh5m6__UkAS4ozbhci7-IPtupZ9ckvSSGPttXHRJtx88IXA181hfgjqhmSeMdAMbaDBw1h8KqmQrZ7_Dh4FxLdUug.png)\n## Who Can Leverage Proof of Invention? \n  * **For Early-Stage Inventors:** PoI is ideal for inventors and researchers who need a secure, affordable way to document their ideas before sharing them with others, eliminating the costs and complexities of provisional patents. \n  * **For Decentralized Scientific Communities (like BioDAOs):** PoI helps them track innovation, attribute credit to original thinkers, and incentivize new discoveries within their communities. \n\n\n‍\n## Why Use Proof-of-Invention?\n  * **Facilitates IP Tokenization:** If an inventor pursues further protection, their onchain proof can be used later in the IP-NFT minting process, enabling tokenization of their intellectual property.\n  * **Compatible with traditional IP systems:** PoI aligns with existing IP systems, allowing inventors to use it as evidence when filing patents or presenting their idea in legal proceedings.\n  * **Effortless and transparent:** With just a few clicks, inventors can create a verifiable, immutable proof of their work. \n\n\n‍\n## How It Works \n  1. **Connect:** Connect to the platform using either your email or your web3 native wallet, such as Metamask.\n  2. **Present files:** Present the confidential files that describe your novel invention. Inventions remain secret as content is never disclosed.\n  3. **Generate proof:** A unique hash is created and linked to your wallet, proving you're the original creator.\n  4. **Verify ownership:** Easily prove you're the original creator at any point in time by revealing only a portion of your invention.\n\n\nExplore more [here](https://poi.molecule.xyz/). \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/67b5f41dbee559152bb91603_AD_4nXcTJHs4LEF-i4lrm1Qv-5p67DjrsJlwtwGW83IhdyNLOcQb8SeC0ns501no3YJKKVQlK0ExoAyfCfbVDN9NG2D4xbmplcPQwASlbFNBhe5R1Nr86pkdZdhtxV_sR6q4C3prbAkt9Q.png)\n## Pilot Partners & Early Impact \nProof of Invention has already been shaping the future of onchain scientific IP with early pilot partners paving the way for its full-scale launch.

Research is built on data (and sometimes code) that routinely isn't shared, affecting our ability to replicate science. Further, incentives - grants, funding, publications, impact factor - have a profound effect on the science and its quality, often to its detriment.\nIn the future, research will continue to be human-directed, but contributions towards it will become more autonomous, enabled by open systems, [advances in AI](https://a16z.com/2019/11/19/ai-industrializing-discovery-biology-healthcare/), scientific tools, and a shift from the world of atoms into the world of bits. Autonomous in this context means a few things: 1) scientists (perhaps anyone with skill and a laptop) will have the freedom to contribute broadly to many different collaborative experiments via the internet and 2) the science itself will become more iterative, recursive and automated (see “[closed loop science](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1900548116)”). \nIn this context, we are building a new intellectual property (IP) system and [structure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) that enables[ broad collaboration](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-emergence-of-biotech-daos) and incentivizes the right participants (including AI drug hunters or contract research organizations) to contribute to research. We envision this as a decentralized, trusted IP network, run on [IP-NFTs](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/technical-documentation/ip-nft).\n**IP-NFTs upgrade our legacy intellectual system by unifying IP (patents, legal), underlying data (through decentralized storage and access control), and economics (royalties, license fees, sales) into one programmable, transactable, digital unit.**\nAn IP network can function like [an open-access IP commons](https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/reports/commoning-intellectual-property), enabling permissionless collaboration and free IP cross-licensing among participants who agree to a common set of terms. Decentralized, trusted IP networks reduce IP risk, increase freedom to operate, and increase IP quality. We see them as the first step towards adopting a global, decentralized intellectual property system, with IP-NFTs as the base layer primitive. \n## How will IP-NFTs enable drug development in the future?\nSoon, scientists will have the ability to connect to a network, automatically cross-license into the network’s collective IP, and collaborate to solve common problems. Along the way, each scientist will get paid and incentivised according to a transparent, community-governed network remuneration model. \nIncreasingly, drug development will happen computationally, directed by the digital inputs of researchers, patients, funders, and communities that collaborate online. [Bio DAOs](https://www.molecule.to/blog/the-emergence-of-biotech-daos) are the first iteration of this system in action, and [IP-NFTs](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm) the first version of the incentive layer that will power it. \nAs computational capabilities scale and algorithms become more sophisticated, more experiments that would traditionally be conducted [_in vivo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo), will be conducted in a digital, simulated environment. The most expensive experiments - those where real world validation is required - will happen through cloud and robotics laboratories (eg. [LabDAO](https://www.labdao.com/), [Arctoris](https://www.arctoris.com/molecule-partnership/)), following highly standardized procedures to generate replicable results. AI will take on traditionally human tasks such as data collection and analysis, while humans will focus on formulating hypotheses and proposing experiments.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/63a2df5ba162c1a1de11efe6_KXE2ZPrU02exSxri8Cyq2ibJIKL1M5-JWlJx1by33788N82JJHglRsKt1MzZ54JhYMVvwFr05mcEriSIy4dXU_EbQCe1eHaUSjNyzfUksUnDKlqd07hBZ69UQAHol5wmXk64QDCJ5ph5BC9bPOtyOy_p27rPhK_yXogMwLkYu4NcyGaFxLG1gc7PAYds.png)\n**IP-NFTs represent a leap forward over the legacy system - a new digital intellectual property primitive that enables legal ownership, transactions, attestations, and data access control around an asset to be programmed digitally in a unified way -** secured and running on the underlying foundational capabilities of [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) as a permissionless global settlement layer. \nIP-NFTs are capable of distributing ownership based on contributions made to the development of a new technology without the overhead of typical IP deals. This turns IP ownership into a much leaner and dynamic incentive, one where contributions to a project can be quickly rewarded with stakes in an asset proportional to their contribution. \nAt Molecule, we are building out [IP-NFTs](https://www.molecule.to/blog/announcing-the-first-biopharma-ip-nft-transaction) to enable this vision, with drug development as a proof of concept. However, this new global intellectual property system is broadly extensible beyond biopharma, and upgrades current shortcomings with jurisdictionally limited forms of intellectual property such as patents. \n## Let’s talk through a current example of how this system could work\nWe look at a group of stakeholders collaborating to develop a therapeutic:\n  1. **Funders, patients, and communities****‍**\n  2. **Researchers** make proposals to the system for projects that contribute to solving the disease. Proposals are evaluated quickly based on continuously optimized criteria for success. Successful proposals receive funding, and in exchange for that funding, _funders and patients_ receive ownership in IP. _Researchers_ leverage _computational biologists and CROs_ to perform the necessary experiments. \n  3. When necessary, **biotech and pharmaceutical companies** outlicense the IP from the system to advance human clinical trials and bring the IP to market. \n  4. Licensing fees and revenue generated flow back to the smart contract (eg. DAO) controlled by **funders and patients** to enable further research to be funded in this manner.   \n‍\n\n\nIn practice, there can be many researchers, service providers, funders, patients, biotechs and pharmas (which might look quite different in the future) all contributing to a research project’s success through this shared incentive. \n‍**We believe that with an open, digital and autonomous system such as this, research can be accelerated at a much faster rate than is currently possible. This is the vision for the future of research we are working towards - a world where scientists and researchers can collaborate to find cures more quickly and efficiently without the need for costly IP transfer agreements.**\n**‍** Trusted IP networks will leverage the domain expertise of its members to validate the IP across the network. IP quality control as a service is badly needed when [roughly half](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/evolving-ip-marketplace/mlemley_ip.pdf) of all litigated patents are found to be invalid. The same expertise will also be used to serve a private dispute resolution layer, ensuring that IP disputes are more efficiently and more fairly resolved by other network members, as opposed to the lay public. Webs of trusted IP networks will create open-access corridors and IP commercialization cooperatives, creating a more global, interoperable IP system.\nIn summary, with IP-NFTs we envision a future in which intellectual property ownership is no longer limited by jurisdiction or paper contracts, but instead distributed among stakeholders on the basis of their contributions to projects. A world where autonomous systems enable rapid iterative experimentation and data collection, while humans focus on formulating hypotheses and programming experiments. Finally, a world in which funders and patients are rewarded for successful outcomes through ownership stakes in IP.\n## The IP-NFT empowers researchers to unlock the full potential of their research \nAssembled into networks and coupled with a powerful public marketplace and community working to advance the research, IP-NFTs bring about a novel way for researchers to get discovered by communities and funders that wish to support their research. This approach aims to enable more people to get involved in funding research and to receive frictionless funding without the need for patents or start-ups early on. All of this is underwritten by fully compliant legal contracts that ensure that this work is enforceable in the real world initially, while long-term scaling into the IP networks described above. It also aims to explore new possibilities for monetization and funding mechanisms (patent pools could explore harberger taxation or other mechanisms to open up patent licensing to the broad public).\nUltimately, the IP-NFT aims to revolutionize research funding and intellectual property with a goal of making it more agile, accessible, and adaptable for inventors, funders, and the public beneficiaries of a technology. We are excited to collaboratively this space, and also see how others contribute towards this vision. \n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/63a2e28cbbec1b62291eb3b1_Screenshot%202022-12-21%20at%2012.39.40.png)\n## Our vision is to enable open decentralized science building blocks, that are interoperable \n  * On-chain research execution (eg.

Additionally, while many therapeutics are discovered in academic labs, funding in academia is preferentially allocated to established researchers and research fields, to the detriment of early career researchers and higher risk projects. The result is an ecosystem where potentially impactful research goes unfunded, and incentives for collaboration are often missing. \nMolecule aims to address these incentive problems and funding gaps. We are creating an open ecosystem that assists researchers in raising funds for impactful research projects in a community-driven way. With Molecule, diverse communities (including patient groups, researchers, charities, VCs and pharma companies) can fund, own and govern therapeutic intellectual property. This provides novel incentives for collaboration, investment, and risk-sharing. The result is that communities, such as patient groups, can choose which projects get funded, and later own the therapeutics that treat their disease.\n## The Molecule ecosystem has three components\n1) **Communities:** A community of physicians, scientists, and patients collaborate to form funding groups in specific therapeutic areas e.g. rare diseases and Alzheimer’s disease. These groups are structured as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which allow for community governance and shared financial decision-making. Molecule seeds DAOs in impactful therapeutic areas, such as [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), a community of 5,000+ members focused on aging and longevity that has funded >$2m in projects in academic labs across the world.\n2) **A new Intellectual Property primitive:** Molecule has created [a new legal primitive for intellectual property (IP) ownership called IP-NFTs](https://www.molecule.to/blog/ip-nfts-for-researchers-a-new-biomedical-funding-paradigm) that allows communities to invest in early stage research IP. IP-NFTs allow researchers to fundraise without needing to patent early or create a startup. \n3) **A marketplace to enable direct investment into researchers' work** : Molecule is [building a marketplace for biotech IP](https://www.molecule.to/blog/an-open-bazaar-for-drug-development-molecule-protocol). Researchers at any career stage submit projects for funding, increasing discoverability of neglected research areas, and addressing key funding gaps.\nAs a result, Molecule aims to help bring innovative therapeutics to market in a more efficient, transparent and equitable way.\n> _“Many of the most impactful therapeutics are discovered in academic labs, yet development and translation of these assets toward the clinic remains difficult. Molecule’s marketplace and IP-NFT framework will address many of the pain points inherent in the funding and commercialization of early-stage biotech IP, ultimately benefiting the most important stakeholder in the Molecule ecosystem – the patient. Northpond is excited to partner with Molecule and lead their seed round.” - Patrick Malone, MD PhD, Associate at Northpond Ventures._\n## Molecule: what’s to come\nThe capital raised will be used to grow our marketplace with hundreds of research projects, expand our team, build out our protocol and technology layer into an open infrastructure, and provide grants to patient-centric biotech DAOs to expand our DeSci ecosystem. We also hope to out-license the first NFT-based IP to industry, demonstrating for the first time patient-led translational drug development.\n‍ _“Scientific research today suffers from a myriad of funding and intermediation issues, making it a ripe candidate for disruption by blockchain-based infrastructure. We’re incredibly excited for Molecule to improve capital & social coordination for the massive life science industry by enabling markets for drug development and turning all stages of intellectual property into liquid assets.”_ - Lasse Clausen, Founding Partner of 1kx\n_\"Many of us are tired of hearing about NFT monkeys selling for millions. Molecule is using the NFT framework for something truly important: helping incredible scientific research transition from the lab bench to the benefit of all. Molecule’s work will help more life-saving drugs get to patients. That's an application of web3 that's easy to get excited about.\"_ - Seth Bannon, Founding Partner at Fifty Years.\nTo truly decentralize adoption, we are also building accelerator frameworks for the friction-less launch of biotech DAOs targeting specific diseases of high unmet need, such as rare diseases and mental health. We see a future where scientists raise funds from incentive-aligned communities that wish to support them, and where patients themselves have governance over how therapeutics are researched, developed and accessed. \n_“The operational complexity, significant time, and prohibitive cost required to develop biotechnology therapeutics has led to an industry that is dominated by capital providers and captured by pharmaceutical companies. Molecule is flipping biotech on its head, bringing stakeholders together at inception to initiate projects, keeping scientists at the center of their innovations, and pushing projects forward that typically would not see the light of day in the current market structure. Molecule has the opportunity to change the face of biotech forever by helping to bring novel drugs and therapeutics to those who are most invested in them. Molecule and its visionary team can finally ensure that we privilege innovation in healthcare.”_ - Mo Koyfman, Founder and General Partner of Shine Capital.\n## Our journey since inception\nSince our pre-seed in early 2020, the team has grown to 22 members spread across the US, South-Africa and Europe, operating in a semi-remote fashion. Over these past few years, we have funded a first group of projects, and helped build the first biotech DAO - [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com) - which has deployed $2m+ to fund longevity research to date, including research at the [Scheibye-Knudsen Lab](https://www.molecule.to/blog/announcing-the-first-biopharma-ip-nft-transaction) (University of Copenhagen), [Viktor Korolchuk's Lab](https://discover.molecule.to/projects/cl4o42oq8070309jo2wkopvqt) (University of Newcastle) and the [Evandro Fang Lab](https://molecule.to/blog/molecules-ip-nft-is-now-facilitating-alzheimer-s-research-at-the-university-of-oslo) (University of Oslo) all using Molecule’s IP-NFT framework. Our hope is that DeSci will provide a Copernican shift in access to therapeutics, of similar magnitude to what DeFi has become for traditional finance.  \n  \n_\"Programmatic IP rights represented as NFTs are a breakthrough innovation with the potential to solve some of humanity's most pressing (incentive) problems. We believe that Molecule is a category defining project which will inspire a wave of innovators bringing the concept of collective ownership and liquid IP markets into various areas of R &D. We're grateful for having been part of Molecule's journey since inception and couldn't be more excited about what's to come.\"_ - Alexander Lange, Founding GP at Inflection VC\n## Our investors\nWe are incredibly grateful and excited to welcome our new investors: Northpond Ventures, Shine Capital, 1kx, Fifty Years, The LAO, BACKED VC, ZeePrime Capital, L1 Digital, Seed Club Ventures, IDTheory, Compound VC, Pillar VC, Inflection VC, Protocol Labs, BoxGroup, KdT Ventures, IDTheory, Boom Capital, Gaingels, Cherry Ventures, Amino Collective, Chorus One, OrangeDAO, BeakerDAO, Nathaniel Manning, Speedinvest, Bool Capital, Koji Capital, Healthspan Capital, Breyer Capital.\nChris Leiter, Zen Chu, Allison Duettman, Pamir Gelenbe, Katelyn Donnelly, Steve Wiggins, Balaji Srinivasan, Piers Kicks, Qiao Wang, Brian Fabian Crain, Scott Moore, Philipp Banhardt, Meher Roy, Ajay Rayasam, Angelo Tagliabue, Collin Myers, Jonas Keller, Garret MacDonald, Luis Cuende, Theodor Walker, Ronjon Nag, Alok Tayi, Laurence Ion, Todd White, Tim Peterson, Jahed Momand, Laurens De Poorter, Andrew Steinwold, Tim Schlidt, Justin Olshavsky & some who remain anonymous.\nWe’re incredibly grateful for the follow-on investment from our pre-seed investors who also participated in this round: Inflection VC, Amino Collective, IDTheory, Andrew Keys, and our other earliest supporters: Lunar Ventures, Possible Ventures, First Principles VC, Signature Ventures and James Brodie.\n‍\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fcf3f3d3283226f94ef2d03/62ba1853de942a1d20a74d60_Screenshot%202022-06-27%20at%2022.45.57.png)\nMolecule's Investors\n## How to get involved\n1.
