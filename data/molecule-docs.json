In contrast, raising research funding via IP-NFTs provides access to an internet-native, globally-sourced capital pool, with the click of a few buttons. \nNo more waiting for months to hear back from bureaucratic organizations who only fund projects that fit their biases, no more pulling out of term sheets at the last second by investors, just execution of instantaneous and immutable smart contracts. Researchers can leverage the global interest of patients and related stakeholders to continue their work, execute on the highest impact (not the most likely to get funded), and create a global community of supporters. \nStreamlining Collaboration\nUtilizing IP-NFTs introduces a well-coordinated method for the supervision and transference of both IP and R&D data rights, fostering a platform for productive scientific collaboration. IP-NFTs intrinsically carry legal rights, and ensure those rights are seamlessly linked with the tokens throughout any exchanges. This consolidation of data rights generates aligned incentives and trustless collaboration between among scientific communities. With faster exchange of incentives, scientific collaboration can move at the speed of information. \nWith an on-chain record of ownership and management details, IP-NFTs can significantly streamline due diligence in IP licensing. The transparency and immutability of blockchain records can drive down the costs and complexities of confirming patent holders, tracking licensees, and researching prior valuations, bypassing the need for intermediaries. No more fear over another scientist stealing your ideas, just building on top of others' ideas with a ledger of record of attribution and value. \nCreation of New IP Markets and Integration with DeFi\nIP-NFTs can dramatically enhance liquidity in typically stagnant IP markets, traditionally bogged down by complex legal processes standing in the way of collaboration and IP exchange. IP-NFTs provide a straightforward, transparent platform for the exchange and consolidation of IP assets, offering a stark contrast to traditional, labor-intensive transactions. This seamless on-chain mechanism can fundamentally transform how IP transactions are conducted.\nIP-NFTs enable the development of early-stage IP markets. By bundling potential IP from an upcoming R&D project into an early-stage IP-NFT, researchers can trade IP rights more efficiently, even before incurring the costs associated with filing patent protections. As a project progresses, late-stage IP-NFTs can encapsulate rights to trade secrets and patents, introducing innovative mechanisms for decentralized IP ownership, governance, and commercialization.\nThrough their compatibility with decentralized finance (DeFi) components, IP-NFTs can be integrated with other digital assets and software components.

    "text": "Technical Details for Developers | Molecule Docs\nYou can find all relevant IP-NFT contract sources on our official Github repo. Runnable versions of the code samples depicted in this article can be found in the accompanying samples repo.\nNon Fungible Tokens in a Nutshell\nNon fungible tokens (NFTs) are smart contract based assets that associate a unique token identifier with the blockchain address of its respective owner. The underlying smart contract defines rules on how they are minted (brought into existence), transferred, or burned (destroyed). It also can restrict their ability to be transferred or offer features that are unlocked for individual token holders.\nIP-NFTs use the common ERC-721 NFT standard with minting, burning and metadata extensions. The IP-NFT collection contract is deployed on Mainnet and on Görli Testnet, you can find the addresses here. Each token's metadata is stored as a file descriptor URI (e.g. ar://HxXKCIE0skR4siRNYeLKI61Vwg_TJ5PJTbxQmtO0EPo) that must be resolved client side, e.g. by using decentralized storage network gateways (Arweave or IPFS). The contract is non-enumerable, i.e. users can't simply query their owned assets on-chain but instead must rely on reading the respective event logs to build their own off-chain state. We've deployed TheGraph subgraphs on mainnet and on Görli that can be queried for asset ownership and other IP-NFT related information.\nHere's a GraphQL example of how to query IP-NFT data from the subgraph:\nquery IPNFTsOf($owner: ID!) { ipnfts(where: {owner: $owner}) { id owner createdAt tokenURI } }\nVariables:\n{ \"owner\": \"0xf7990cd398dafb4fe5fd6b9228b8e6f72b296555\" }\nResult:\n{ \"data\": { \"ipnfts\": [ { \"id\": \"2\", \"owner\": \"0xf7990cd398dafb4fe5fd6b9228b8e6f72b296555\", \"createdAt\": \"1686582803\", \"tokenURI\": \"ipfs://bafkreig274nfj7srmtnb5wd5wlwm3ig2s63wovlz7i3noodjlfz2tm3n5q\" } ] } }\nWe've deployed the contracts as UUPS proxies owned by the Molecule developer team's multisig, thus the contract you're interacting with and the contract that contains the current logic are different. Make sure to always invoke functions on the UUPS proxy - its official addresses can be found here. The implementation contracts have been verified on Etherscan, so you can easily retrieve their ABIs.\nReserve an IP-NFT Token ID\nIP-NFTs can generally be minted by any account. The first step on the minting journey is to reserve an IP-NFT token id by calling the IP-NFT contract's reserve() method. This capturing step is necessary because the legal documents attached to the final IP-NFT are referring to the NFT's token id that only becomes available after the mint has occurred. Minters will use the token id to craft the legal documents that outline the rights and obligations of owning that NFT in the real world. \nWhen minting an IP-NFT using the molecule frontend, the reserved token id will be inserted in the autogenerated Assignment Agreement. If you're minting IP-NFTs on your own, make sure to correctly mention them in your legal attachments. A selection of premade contract templates for IP-NFTs can be found on Github.\nThe JSON metadata documents behind IP-NFTs are required to strictly validate against a well defined JSON schema that's flexible enough to cover many relevant use cases. Here's a visual tool to investigate a valid IP-NFT's metadata interactively. Note that the generic fields name, image and description are located on the document's root level, whereas the agreements and project_details structures are modelled as rich property definitions.\n{ \"schema_version\": \"0.0.1\", \"name\": \"Our awesome test IP-NFT\", \"description\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...\", \"image\": \"ar://7De6dRLDaMhMeC6Utm9bB9PRbcvKdi-rw_sDM8pJSMU\", \"external_url\": \"https://testnet.mint.molecule.to/ipnft/76\", \"terms_signature\": \"0x...\", \"properties\": { \"type\": \"IP-NFT\", \"agreements\": [ { \"type\": \"License Agreement\", \"url\": \"ar://4FG3GR8qCdLo923tVBC85NTYHaaAc3TvCsF3aZwum_o\", \"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"content_hash\": \"bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\", } ], \"project_details\": { \"industry\": \"Space Exploration\", \"organization\": \"NASA\", \"topic\": \"Wormholes\", \"funding_amount\": { \"value\": 123456789, \"decimals\": 2, \"currency\": \"USD\", \"currency_type\": \"ISO4217\" }, \"research_lead\": { \"name\": \"Carl Sagan\", \"email\": \"carl@example.com\" } } } } \nValidate Metadata Correctness\nTo validate IP-NFT metatadata documents against that schema, you can use arbitrary JSON schema tools. Ajv is one of the most powerful ones in Javascript. We're omitting the code to retrieve schema or documents for brevity's sake but in a nutshell validation boils down to:\nimport Ajv from \"ajv\"; import addFormats from \"ajv-formats\"; (async () => { const ipnftSchema = JSON.parse(ipnftSchemaJson); const document = JSON.parse(ipnftMetadataJson); const ajv = new Ajv(); addFormats(ajv); const validateIpnft = ajv.compile(ipnftSchema); const validationResult = validateIpnft(document); })();\nLink to External Resources\nIP-NFT metadata documents require you to refer to external resources, e.g. the image or agreements[].url fields. While you can choose to go with the well known https:// protocol, it's advisable to use web3-native decentralized storage pointers like ar:// or ipfs:// instead. Clients are supposed to resolve them to their respective http gateway counterparts and most NFT related services and frontends can handle them. You don't need to run an Arweave or IPFS node yourself - Ardrive or web3.storage are excellent helper services that get the job done and our official IP-NFT minting UI uses web3.storage to publish IPFS documents to a reliable storage backend and automatically create storage deals on Filecoin.\nHere's a nodejs example on how to upload a JSON document using web3.storage (it's simpler to do this within a browser context, though):\nimport dotenv from \"dotenv\"; import { Blob } from \"node:buffer\"; import { Web3Storage } from \"web3.storage\"; dotenv.config(); const w3sClient = new Web3Storage({ token: process.env.W3S_TOKEN }); (async () => { const content = { uploaded_at: new Date().toISOString(), }; const binaryContent = new Blob([JSON.stringify(content)], { type: \"application/json\", }); const file = { name: \"filename.json\", stream: () => binaryContent.stream(), }; //@ts-ignore const cid = await w3sClient.put([file], { name: \"some.json\", wrapWithDirectory: false, }); console.log(cid); })();\nresults in an IPFS CIDv1:\nbafkreicrhuxfzrydht6tmd4kyy6pkbhspqthswg6xbiqlaztmf774ojxhq\nTo resolve the published content, you can request it from any public IPFS http gateway. You'll experience the lowest latency when querying a gateway close to the node that you used for uploading; web3.storage offers https://w3s.link for that purpose. Requesting https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafkreicrhuxfzrydht6tmd4kyy6pkbhspqthswg6xbiqlaztmf774ojxhq yields\n{\"uploaded_at\":\"2023-01-02T22:45:17.788Z\"}\nDecentralized Encryption and IP-NFT Token Gating\nAn IP-NFT's most important metadata property are its agreements, another term for legal documents attached to it. These documents refer to the IP-NFT smart contract's (\"collection\") address and the IP-NFT's token id. The agreements' content might contain confidential information about the involved parties and hence should be encrypted before being uploaded. Decentralized and permissionless encryption is a non trivial requirement that we solve by relying on Lit Protocol.\nLit runs a network of nodes that derive signing and encryption keys by multiparty computation / threshold cryptography on trusted computing enclaves. The nodes themselves only know parts of the private key that effectively is fully assembled on the client side after all conditions for key retrieval have been met. Lit protocol allows gating any content behind access control conditions that are backed by blockchain state, therefore it's disclosing decryption keys only to holders of an NFT or users that meet a certain condition on chain.\nLit's documentation lays out the encryption process in detail. To instantiate a Lit SDK instance that's capable of encrypting or decrypting content, it needs an EIP-4361 compatible signature that proves control over the current user's account. Once authenticated we can request a new symmetric key to encrypt our content and ultimately ask the Lit network nodes to store its key shares along with an access control condition. That request yields an encrypted decryption key (😵‍💫) that has been created by the network nodes.\nimport LitJsSdk from '@lit-protocol/sdk-browser' const litClient = new LitJsSdk.LitNodeClient() await client.connect() //connects to Lit network nodes const file: Blob | File = //some file const { encryptedFile, symmetricKey } = await LitJsSdk.encryptFile({ file }) //you can reuse a Siwe / EIP-4361 compatible signed message here, see https://login.xyz/ const authSig = await LitJsSdk.checkAndSignAuthMessage({ chain: \"ethereum\" }); accessControlConditions = { conditionType: 'evmBasic', contractAddress: tokenContractAddress, standardContractType: 'ERC721', chain: \"ethereum\", method: 'ownerOf', parameters: [tokenId], returnValueTest: { comparator: '=', value: ':userAddress' } } const u8encryptedSymmetricKey = await litClient.saveEncryptionKey({ unifiedAccessControlConditions: accessControlConditions, symmetricKey, authSig, chain, permanent: false }) \nA user who wants to decrypt the content must again initialize the Lit SDK using a signed message that proves control over their address. Next, they ask several network nodes to present their key shares of the encrypted key by presenting the access control conditions and the encrypted symmetric key to the network. If the network nodes find that the account matches the given conditions, each one yields its key share for the encrypted decryption key. With that, the SDK decrypts the key the content has initially been encrypted with.\nconst authSig = await LitJsSdk.checkAndSignAuthMessage({ chain: \"ethereum\" }); const symmetricKey = await litClient.getEncryptionKey({ unifiedAccessControlConditions: accessControlConditions, toDecrypt: encryptedSymmetricKey, chain: \"ethereum\", authSig })\nAn IP-NFT metadata's agreements item can store the encrypted symmetric key and its access control conditions inside its encryption field. Note that the IP-NFT JSON schema of access_control_conditions is externally defined by Lit protocol.\n\"agreements\": [ { \"type\": \"License Agreement\", \"url\": \"ar://4FG3GR8qCdLo923tVBC85NTYHaaAc3TvCsF3aZwum_o\", \"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"content_hash\": \"bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\", \"encryption\": { \"protocol\": \"lit\", \"encrypted_sym_key\": \"fcbeaf3af31c7104d1d1f7099a6c6f6fda5803a4f7a0bef93256f3377450291872ad07bed3e9402cb47cc932c8f48219e56b84c06becd5ec0ee83ef2c0c93b932fb675c7932fa8df0ad164f17642b32415e382081577a403c19da2eff22c9083fa134ad1f370c2bec449adcdea790498637c7238b7d67cf2d69507a962656d3200000000000000205e4ad4e6323e06862babc934f740bc2e566d175a5da23bb4f1b35635e5cc3768cd040e8776307ea038484ff42033c18f\", \"access_control_conditions\": [ { \"conditionType\": \"evmBasic\", \"contractAddress\": \"0xaf7358576C9F7cD84696D28702fC5ADe33cce0e9\", \"standardContractType\": \"ERC721\", \"chain\": \"goerli\", \"method\": \"ownerOf\", \"parameters\": [ \"6\" ], \"returnValueTest\": { \"comparator\": \"=\", \"value\": \":userAddress\" } } ] } } ]\nUsing Multisig Wallet Signers\nDue to the high value nature of IP-NFTs you might feel tempted to use a multisig wallet for the minting process, maybe because you'd like to prove that the IP-NFT has been created by a dedicated group of individuals. This works fine for all contract function invocations but is not supported by Lit protocol. Multisig wallets (or contract wallets to be precise) cannot sign messages in the way it's required to authenticate against Lit nodes because they're not based on a private key. This might once be possible by utilizing EIP-1271 compatible wallet signatures but was not supported earlier. We're going to add support for it soon.\nThe recommended workaround is to denote a dedicated trusted member of the multisig that's supposed to intially own the minted IP-NFT. This could be the researcher, a core contributor or maintainer of the project. The IP-NFT contract's mintReservation function takes a recipient parameter (to) that defines the NFT's initial owner. Note, that the account that invokes the mint function is required to hold a mint pass, not the receiver.\nGranting Read Access to Third Parties\nAnother shortcoming related to Lit's requirement of private key based authentication signatures is that multisig token holders cannot prove their address to the protocol. To allow multisig members to decrypt the accompanying agreement documents, the IP-NFT contract contains a grantReadAccess function that can only be invoked by the current token holder (e.g. a multisig) to grant certain accounts (e.g. some of their members or potential buyers) read access to the underlying content for a limited amount of time. Its counterpart canRead yields a boolean whether the reader is currently allowed access. For the current owner of an IP-NFT this method always returns true.\nTo make read grants work inside Lit protocol, one can craft a custom contract access control condition that not only takes the current IP-NFT ownership into account but also lets users pass that currently are granted read access:\n\"encryption\": { \"protocol\": \"lit\", \"encrypted_sym_key\": \"...\", \"access_control_conditions\": [ { \"conditionType\": \"evmContract\", //the IP-NFT UUPS proxy contract address \"contractAddress\": \"0xaf7358576C9F7cD84696D28702fC5ADe33cce0e\", \"chain\": \"goerli\", \"functionName\": \"canRead\", \"functionParams\": [ \":userAddress\", \"10\" ], \"functionAbi\": { \"name\": \"canRead\", \"inputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"address\", \"name\": \"reader\", \"type\": \"address\" }, { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"tokenId\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"outputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"bool\", \"name\": \"\", \"type\": \"bool\" } ], \"stateMutability\": \"view\", \"type\": \"function\" }, \"returnValueTest\": { \"key\": \"\", \"comparator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"true\" } } ] }\nProving Content Integrity\nSince agreement documents are encrypted before being stored, each agreement item may contain a content_hash that downloaders can use to prove the legal documents' content integrity after they've decrypted it. When using IPFS as storage layer this hash is not adding much value since the network's content ids already provide an untamperable way of guaranteeing content integrity, however they're not derived from the original content and hard to prove without an IPFS node at hand.\nThe content_hash field shall contain the sha-256 digest of the attachment's binary content, encoded as a multihash compatible to CIDv1. This allows users to decode the content hash and verify document's content without being aware of the hashing algorithm used. This is how it looks like in Typescript using the multiformats NPM package:\nimport { CID } from \"multiformats/cid\"; import * as json from \"multiformats/codecs/json\"; import { sha256 } from \"multiformats/hashes/sha2\"; const checksum = async (u8: Uint8Array) => { //https://multiformats.io/multihash/ const digest = await sha256.digest(u8); return CID.create(1, json.code, digest); }; const verifyChecksum = async ( u8: Uint8Array, _cid: string ): Promise<boolean> => { const cid = CID.parse(_cid); //https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L9 console.log(\"hash algo used: 0x%s\", cid.multihash.code.toString(16)); const digest = await sha256.digest(u8); return cid.multihash.bytes.every((el, i) => el === digest.bytes[i]); }; (async () => { const binaryContent = new TextEncoder().encode(\"This is the content\"); const cid = await checksum(binaryContent); const valid = await verifyChecksum(binaryContent, cid.toString()); console.log(cid, valid); })(); \nTerms and Validation signatures \nSign off legal terms and agreements' content\nSome of the attached legal PDF documents might contain a reference on being only valid when being digitally signed by an individual party. IP-NFTs that are minted from within the Molecule ecosystem must carry an EIP-191 compatible message with a personal signature. We refer to this structure as TermsSig. It proves that a party has agreed to terms shown on a website or mentioned in legal contracts.\nA TermsSig V1 contains the following information\na \"banner\"\na list of terms the minter has agreed to sign\na list of document hashes, keyed by their document type\na version indicator\nthe chain id on which this signature should be considered valid\nExample:\nI accept the IP-NFT minting terms I have read and agreed to the terms of the IP-NFT Assignment Agreement I understand that the IP-NFT represents legal rights to IP and data of the project in my Research Agreement I understand that this in an irreversible and publicly traceable transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain I understand this is beta software and agree to the Terms of Service and assume all risks of minting this IP-NFT Sponsored Research Agreement Hash: bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq Assignment Agreement Hash: bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq Version: 1 Chain ID: 5\nYou can use any EIP-191 compatible ecrecover function to prove who has signed these terms. Etherscan comes with a dedicated feature to publicly prove messages and signatures to simplify this process.\nVerify and sign off final metadata\nThere's no way for the IP-NFT contract to verify that the metadata one provides is valid. To ensure its formal validity and completeness, we're therefore running a service that's signing off valid metadata with a signature that must be presented to the mintReservation function. These are the accounts and service endpoints of signers trusted by the IP-NFT contracts: \nHere's a sample request\nPOST https://mint.molecule.to/api/signoffMetadata Content-Type: application/json { \"network\": \"homestead\", \"minter\": \"0xcB0b20A55e188eD52F1af694e2a3bCb9e81e3911\", \"to\": \"0xD920E60b798A2F5a8332799d8a23075c9E77d5F8\", \"reservationId\": 2, \"tokenURI\": \"ipfs://bafkreibkvbe5n4iub7jac4cuhlokmdpt6fkv64x4huhy3gvgpbjf6ggzpa\" }\nnetwork the network alias the IP-NFT is being minted on (homestead for mainnet)\nminter the minter's account that has signed the terms included in the metadata\ntokenURI the final, resolvable metadata URI\nto the minting recipient address\nreservationId the reservation id that's going to minted (becomes the IP-NFT id after mint) \nThe signoff service will\ndownload the metadata from the provided tokenURI (which proves its availability)\ncheck whether the metadata conforms to the IP-NFT metadata schema\nchecks whether the metadata's terms_signature recovers to the minter address \nIf that's the case, it will sign keccak256(minter, to, reservationId, tokenURI) with an account the IP-NFT contract accepts as verifier and yield it as response. \n{ \"status\": \"ok\", \"tokenURI\": \"ipfs://bafkreibkvbe5n4iub7jac4cuhlokmdpt6fkv64x4huhy3gvgpbjf6ggzpa\", \"authorization\": \"0x171e5282e55f178eb384723d6b9e52181cab154ecf399ff1940211a1b80f1c7f0590103a49ea47dca7c4d7667a7ab640f3e836141b32c06aeb8819daec2d673c1c\", \"signer\": \"0x3d30452c48f2448764d5819a9a2b684ae2cc5acf\" }\nThe response's authorization signature bytes are then provided as the IP-NFTs mintReservation function's authorization parameter \nCall the mint function\nThe remaining final step to mint an IP-NFT is calling the smart contract's mintReservation function:\nfunction mintReservation( address to, uint256 reservationId, string calldata _tokenURI, string calldata _symbol, bytes calldata authorization ) external payable override whenNotPaused returns (uint256)\nwith the parameters: \nto the recipient of the new IP-NFT (e.g. a multisig wallet)\nreservationId the reserved IP-NFT id as received by the initial call to reserve()\n_tokenURI the URI that resolves to the metadata\n_symbol a short symbol that identifies the IP-NFT and its derivatives\nauthorization a bytes encoded signature by the validation service\nand a value of 0.001 etherthat deals as symbolic minting fee.\nPutting it all together: The IP-NFT Minting Flow\nTo sum up, minting an IP-NFT technically requires the following steps:\ninvoke the IP-NFT contract's reserve() function to reserve a token id\nget the reserved token id by parsing the method's event log or use the subgraph\nupload an image to a (de)centralised network of your choice\nuse the token id and the IP-NFT contract's address to create legal documents\ncompute a checksum over the original documents\noptionally encrypt the documents with a Lit access control condition\nassemble a metadata structure containing the file pointers, access control conditions, encrypted symmetric key and checksum\ncraft a TermsSig message, sign it off by the minting account and add it to the metadata\nverify that the metadata validates against the publicly known IPNFT schema\nupload the metadata to a (de)centralised network of your choice\ncall the molecule validation service with your metadata URI to sign it off \ninvoke mintReservation on the IP-NFT contract",
    "markdown": "# Technical Details for Developers | Molecule Docs\n\nYou can find all relevant IP-NFT contract sources on our official [Github repo](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/IPNFT). Runnable versions of the code samples depicted in this article can be found in the accompanying [samples repo](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/ipnft-samples).\n\n## \n\nNon Fungible Tokens in a Nutshell\n\nNon fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/)) are smart contract based assets that associate a unique token identifier with the blockchain address of its respective owner. The underlying smart contract defines rules on how they are minted (brought into existence), transferred, or burned (destroyed). It also can restrict their ability to be transferred or offer features that are unlocked for individual token holders.\n\nIP-NFTs use the common [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) NFT standard with minting, burning and metadata extensions. The IP-NFT collection contract is deployed on Mainnet and on Görli Testnet, you can find the addresses [here](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/smart-contract-addresses). Each token's metadata is stored as a file descriptor URI (e.g. `ar://HxXKCIE0skR4siRNYeLKI61Vwg_TJ5PJTbxQmtO0EPo`) that must be resolved client side, e.g. by using decentralized storage network gateways ([Arweave](https://arweave.news/introduction-to-the-most-important-infrastructure-in-the-ar-ecosystem-ar-gateway/) or [IPFS](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/)). The contract is non-enumerable, i.e. users can't simply query their owned assets on-chain but instead must rely on reading the respective event logs to build their own off-chain state. We've deployed TheGraph subgraphs [on mainnet](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/moleculeprotocol/ip-nft-mainnet) and [on Görli](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/elmariachi111/schrotti-galoppi-schmacko-1/graphql) that can be queried for asset ownership and other IP-NFT related information.\n\nHere's a GraphQL example of how to query IP-NFT data from the subgraph:\n\n```\nquery IPNFTsOf($owner: ID!)\n{\n  ipnfts(where: {owner: $owner}) {\n    id\n    owner\n    createdAt\n    tokenURI\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVariables:\n\n```\n{\n  \"owner\": \"0xf7990cd398dafb4fe5fd6b9228b8e6f72b296555\"\n}\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"ipnfts\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"2\",\n        \"owner\": \"0xf7990cd398dafb4fe5fd6b9228b8e6f72b296555\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"1686582803\",\n        \"tokenURI\": \"ipfs://bafkreig274nfj7srmtnb5wd5wlwm3ig2s63wovlz7i3noodjlfz2tm3n5q\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe've deployed the contracts as [UUPS proxies](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable) owned by the [Molecule developer team's multisig](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth:0xCfA0F84660fB33bFd07C369E5491Ab02C449f71B), thus the contract you're interacting with and the contract that contains the current logic are different. Make sure to always invoke functions on the UUPS proxy - its official addresses can be found [here](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/smart-contract-addresses). The implementation contracts have been verified on Etherscan, so you can [easily retrieve their ABIs](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b179dffac5e190c670176606f552cb792847f80#code).\n\n## \n\nReserve an IP-NFT Token ID\n\nIP-NFTs can generally be minted by any account. The first step on the minting journey is to reserve an IP-NFT token id by calling the IP-NFT contract's `reserve()` method. This capturing step is necessary because the legal documents attached to the final IP-NFT are referring to the NFT's token id that only becomes available after the mint has occurred. Minters will use the token id to craft the legal documents that outline the rights and obligations of owning that NFT in the real world.\n\nWhen minting an IP-NFT using the molecule frontend, the reserved token id will be inserted in the autogenerated Assignment Agreement. If you're minting IP-NFTs on your own, make sure to correctly mention them in your legal attachments. A selection of premade contract templates for IP-NFTs can be found [on Github](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/Legal-Contracts).\n\nThe JSON metadata documents behind IP-NFTs are required to strictly validate against a [well defined JSON schema that's](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeihvql52zxnkksedcad5i6ptimpquu4oiek56ojldkm3ndkfoevmf4/ipnft.schema.json) flexible enough to cover many relevant use cases. [Here's a visual tool](https://jsonschema.dev/s/ciB7W) to investigate a valid IP-NFT's metadata interactively. Note that the generic fields `name`, `image` and `description` are located on the document's root level, whereas the `agreements` and `project_details` structures are modelled as rich property definitions.\n\n```\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"name\": \"Our awesome test IP-NFT\",\n  \"description\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...\",\n  \"image\": \"ar://7De6dRLDaMhMeC6Utm9bB9PRbcvKdi-rw_sDM8pJSMU\",\n  \"external_url\": \"https://testnet.mint.molecule.to/ipnft/76\",\n  \"terms_signature\": \"0x...\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"type\": \"IP-NFT\",\n    \"agreements\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"License Agreement\",\n        \"url\": \"ar://4FG3GR8qCdLo923tVBC85NTYHaaAc3TvCsF3aZwum_o\",\n        \"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\",\n        \"content_hash\": \"bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\",\n      }\n    ],\n    \"project_details\": {\n      \"industry\": \"Space Exploration\",\n      \"organization\": \"NASA\",\n      \"topic\": \"Wormholes\",\n      \"funding_amount\": {\n        \"value\": 123456789,\n        \"decimals\": 2,\n        \"currency\": \"USD\",\n        \"currency_type\": \"ISO4217\"\n      },\n      \"research_lead\": {\n        \"name\": \"Carl Sagan\",\n        \"email\": \"carl@example.com\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### \n\nValidate Metadata Correctness\n\nTo validate IP-NFT metatadata documents against that schema, you can use arbitrary JSON schema tools. [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/guide/getting-started.html) is one of the most powerful ones in Javascript. We're omitting [the code](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/ipnft-samples/blob/main/verifyMetadata.mts) to retrieve schema or documents for brevity's sake but in a nutshell validation boils down to:\n\n```\nimport Ajv from \"ajv\";\nimport addFormats from \"ajv-formats\";\n\n(async () => {\n  const ipnftSchema = JSON.parse(ipnftSchemaJson);\n  const document = JSON.parse(ipnftMetadataJson);\n\n  const ajv = new Ajv();\n  addFormats(ajv);\n  const validateIpnft = ajv.compile(ipnftSchema);\n  const validationResult = validateIpnft(document);  \n})();\n```\n\n### \n\nLink to External Resources\n\nIP-NFT metadata documents require you to refer to external resources, e.g. the `image` or `agreements[].url` fields. While you can choose to go with the well known `https://` protocol, it's advisable to use web3-native decentralized storage pointers like `ar://` or `ipfs://` instead. Clients are supposed to resolve them to their respective http gateway counterparts and most NFT related services and frontends can handle them. You don't need to run an Arweave or IPFS node yourself - [Ardrive](https://app.ardrive.io/) or web3.storage are excellent helper services that get the job done and our official IP-NFT minting UI uses web3.storage to publish IPFS documents to a reliable storage backend and automatically create storage deals on Filecoin.\n\nHere's a nodejs example on how to upload a JSON document using web3.storage (it's simpler to do this [within a browser context](https://web3.storage/docs/how-tos/store/#preparing-files-for-upload), though):\n\n```\nimport dotenv from \"dotenv\";\nimport { Blob } from \"node:buffer\";\nimport { Web3Storage } from \"web3.storage\";\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst w3sClient = new Web3Storage({ token: process.env.W3S_TOKEN });\n\n(async () => {\n  const content = {\n    uploaded_at: new Date().toISOString(),\n  };\n\n  const binaryContent = new Blob([JSON.stringify(content)], {\n    type: \"application/json\",\n  });\n\n  const file = {\n    name: \"filename.json\",\n    stream: () => binaryContent.stream(),\n  };\n\n  //@ts-ignore\n  const cid = await w3sClient.put([file], {\n    name: \"some.json\",\n    wrapWithDirectory: false,\n  });\n  console.log(cid);\n})();\n```\n\nresults in an IPFS CIDv1:\n\n```\nbafkreicrhuxfzrydht6tmd4kyy6pkbhspqthswg6xbiqlaztmf774ojxhq\n```\n\nTo resolve the published content, you can request it from any public IPFS http gateway. You'll experience the lowest latency when querying a gateway close to the node that you used for uploading; web3.storage offers `https://w3s.link` for that purpose. Requesting [https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafkreicrhuxfzrydht6tmd4kyy6pkbhspqthswg6xbiqlaztmf774ojxhq](https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafkreicrhuxfzrydht6tmd4kyy6pkbhspqthswg6xbiqlaztmf774ojxhq) yields\n\n```\n{\"uploaded_at\":\"2023-01-02T22:45:17.788Z\"}\n```\n\n## \n\nDecentralized Encryption and IP-NFT Token Gating\n\nAn IP-NFT's most important metadata property are its `agreements`, another term for legal documents attached to it. These documents refer to the IP-NFT smart contract's (\"collection\") address and the IP-NFT's token id. The agreements' content might contain confidential information about the involved parties and hence should be encrypted before being uploaded. Decentralized and permissionless encryption is a non trivial requirement that we solve by relying on [Lit Protocol](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/Explanation/encryption).\n\nLit runs a network of nodes that derive signing and encryption keys by multiparty computation / threshold cryptography on trusted computing enclaves. The nodes themselves only know parts of the private key that effectively is fully assembled on the client side after all conditions for key retrieval have been met. Lit protocol allows gating any content behind access control conditions that are backed by blockchain state, therefore it's disclosing decryption keys only to holders of an NFT or users that meet a certain condition on chain.\n\n[Lit's documentation](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/Explanation/encryption#encrypting) lays out the encryption process in detail. To instantiate a Lit SDK instance that's capable of encrypting or decrypting content, [it needs](https://developer.litprotocol.com/sdk/explanation/walletsigs/authsig/#obtaining-the-authsig) an [EIP-4361](https://login.xyz/) compatible signature that proves control over the current user's account. Once authenticated we can request a new symmetric key to encrypt our content and ultimately ask the Lit network nodes to store its key shares along with an access control condition. That request yields an encrypted decryption key (😵‍💫) that has been created by the network nodes.\n\n```\n  import LitJsSdk from '@lit-protocol/sdk-browser'\n  \n  const litClient = new LitJsSdk.LitNodeClient()\n  await client.connect() //connects to Lit network nodes\n\n  const file: Blob | File = //some file\n  const { encryptedFile, symmetricKey } = await LitJsSdk.encryptFile({ file })\n\n  //you can reuse a Siwe / EIP-4361 compatible signed message here, see https://login.xyz/\n  const authSig = await LitJsSdk.checkAndSignAuthMessage({ chain: \"ethereum\" });\n\n  accessControlConditions = {\n      conditionType: 'evmBasic',\n      contractAddress: tokenContractAddress,\n      standardContractType: 'ERC721',\n      chain: \"ethereum\",\n      method: 'ownerOf',\n      parameters: [tokenId],\n      returnValueTest: {\n        comparator: '=',\n        value: ':userAddress'\n      }\n    }\n\n  const u8encryptedSymmetricKey = await litClient.saveEncryptionKey({\n    unifiedAccessControlConditions: accessControlConditions,\n    symmetricKey,\n    authSig,\n    chain,\n    permanent: false\n  })\n  \n  \n```\n\nA user who wants to decrypt the content must again initialize the Lit SDK using a signed message that proves control over their address. Next, they ask several network nodes to present their key shares of the encrypted key by presenting the access control conditions and the encrypted symmetric key to the network. If the network nodes find that the account matches the given conditions, each one yields its key share for the encrypted decryption key. With that, the SDK decrypts the key the content has initially been encrypted with.\n\n```\nconst authSig = await LitJsSdk.checkAndSignAuthMessage({ chain: \"ethereum\" });\nconst symmetricKey = await litClient.getEncryptionKey({\n    unifiedAccessControlConditions: accessControlConditions,\n    toDecrypt: encryptedSymmetricKey,\n    chain: \"ethereum\",\n    authSig\n})\n```\n\nAn IP-NFT metadata's `agreements` item can store the encrypted symmetric key and its access control conditions inside its `encryption` field. Note that the IP-NFT JSON schema of `access_control_conditions` is externally [defined by Lit protocol](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-accs-validator-sdk/tree/main/src/schemas).\n\n```\n\"agreements\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"License Agreement\",\n    \"url\": \"ar://4FG3GR8qCdLo923tVBC85NTYHaaAc3TvCsF3aZwum_o\",\n    \"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\",\n    \"content_hash\": \"bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\",\n    \"encryption\": {\n      \"protocol\": \"lit\",\n      \"encrypted_sym_key\": \"fcbeaf3af31c7104d1d1f7099a6c6f6fda5803a4f7a0bef93256f3377450291872ad07bed3e9402cb47cc932c8f48219e56b84c06becd5ec0ee83ef2c0c93b932fb675c7932fa8df0ad164f17642b32415e382081577a403c19da2eff22c9083fa134ad1f370c2bec449adcdea790498637c7238b7d67cf2d69507a962656d3200000000000000205e4ad4e6323e06862babc934f740bc2e566d175a5da23bb4f1b35635e5cc3768cd040e8776307ea038484ff42033c18f\",\n      \"access_control_conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"conditionType\": \"evmBasic\",\n          \"contractAddress\": \"0xaf7358576C9F7cD84696D28702fC5ADe33cce0e9\",\n          \"standardContractType\": \"ERC721\",\n          \"chain\": \"goerli\",\n          \"method\": \"ownerOf\",\n          \"parameters\": [\n            \"6\"\n          ],\n          \"returnValueTest\": {\n            \"comparator\": \"=\",\n            \"value\": \":userAddress\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### \n\nUsing Multisig Wallet Signers\n\nDue to the high value nature of IP-NFTs you might feel tempted to use a multisig wallet for the minting process, maybe because you'd like to prove that the IP-NFT has been created by a dedicated group of individuals. This works fine for all contract function invocations but is not supported by Lit protocol. Multisig wallets (or contract wallets to be precise) cannot sign messages in the way it's required to authenticate against Lit nodes because they're not based on a private key. This might once be possible by utilizing [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) compatible wallet signatures but [was not supported](https://discord.com/channels/896185694857343026/916383445784096839/1058018912010248232) earlier. We're going to add [support for it](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/Explanation/WalletSigs/authSig#how-to-structure-the-authsig) soon.\n\nThe recommended workaround is to denote a dedicated trusted member of the multisig that's supposed to intially own the minted IP-NFT. This could be the researcher, a core contributor or maintainer of the project. The IP-NFT contract's `mintReservation` function takes a recipient parameter (`to`) that defines the NFT's initial owner. Note, that the account that _invokes_ the mint function is required to hold a mint pass, not the receiver.\n\n### \n\nGranting Read Access to Third Parties\n\nAnother shortcoming related to Lit's requirement of private key based authentication signatures is that multisig token holders cannot prove their address to the protocol. To allow multisig members to decrypt the accompanying agreement documents, the IP-NFT contract contains a [`grantReadAccess`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x36444254795ce6E748cf0317EEE4c4271325D92A#writeProxyContract#F3) function that can only be invoked by the current token holder (e.g. a multisig) to grant certain accounts (e.g. some of their members or potential buyers) read access to the underlying content for a limited amount of time. Its counterpart [`canRead`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x36444254795ce6E748cf0317EEE4c4271325D92A#readProxyContract#F3) yields a boolean whether the `reader` is currently allowed access. For the current owner of an IP-NFT this method always returns `true`.\n\nTo make read grants work inside Lit protocol, one can craft a [custom contract access control condition](https://developer.litprotocol.com/coreConcepts/accessControl/EVM/customContractCalls) that not only takes the current IP-NFT ownership into account but also lets users pass that currently are granted read access:\n\n```\n\"encryption\": {\n  \"protocol\": \"lit\",\n  \"encrypted_sym_key\": \"...\",\n  \"access_control_conditions\": [\n    {\n      \"conditionType\": \"evmContract\",\n      //the IP-NFT UUPS proxy contract address\n      \"contractAddress\": \"0xaf7358576C9F7cD84696D28702fC5ADe33cce0e\",\n      \"chain\": \"goerli\",\n      \"functionName\": \"canRead\",\n      \"functionParams\": [\n        \":userAddress\",\n        \"10\"\n      ],\n      \"functionAbi\": {\n        \"name\": \"canRead\",\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"address\",\n            \"name\": \"reader\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\n            \"name\": \"tokenId\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"outputs\": [\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"bool\",\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"type\": \"bool\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"stateMutability\": \"view\",\n        \"type\": \"function\"\n      },\n      \"returnValueTest\": {\n        \"key\": \"\",\n        \"comparator\": \"=\",\n        \"value\": \"true\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### \n\nProving Content Integrity\n\nSince agreement documents are encrypted before being stored, each agreement item may contain a `content_hash` that downloaders can use to prove the legal documents' content integrity after they've decrypted it. When using IPFS as storage layer this hash is not adding much value since the network's content ids already provide an untamperable way of guaranteeing content integrity, however [they're not derived from the original content](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/hashing/#content-identifiers-are-not-file-hashes) and hard to prove without an IPFS node at hand.\n\nThe `content_hash` field shall contain the sha-256 digest of the attachment's binary content, encoded as a multihash compatible to CIDv1. This allows users to decode the content hash and verify document's content without being aware of the hashing algorithm used. This is how it looks like in Typescript using the [multiformats NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multiformats):\n\n```\nimport { CID } from \"multiformats/cid\";\nimport * as json from \"multiformats/codecs/json\";\nimport { sha256 } from \"multiformats/hashes/sha2\";\n\nconst checksum = async (u8: Uint8Array) => {\n  //https://multiformats.io/multihash/\n  const digest = await sha256.digest(u8);\n  return CID.create(1, json.code, digest);\n};\n\nconst verifyChecksum = async (\n  u8: Uint8Array,\n  _cid: string\n): Promise<boolean> => {\n  const cid = CID.parse(_cid);\n  //https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L9\n  console.log(\"hash algo used: 0x%s\", cid.multihash.code.toString(16));\n\n  const digest = await sha256.digest(u8);\n  return cid.multihash.bytes.every((el, i) => el === digest.bytes[i]);\n};\n\n(async () => {\n  const binaryContent = new TextEncoder().encode(\"This is the content\");\n  const cid = await checksum(binaryContent);\n  const valid = await verifyChecksum(binaryContent, cid.toString());\n  console.log(cid, valid);\n})();\n```\n\n## \n\nTerms and Validation signatures\n\n### \n\nSign off legal terms and agreements' content\n\nSome of the attached legal PDF documents might contain a reference on being only valid when being digitally signed by an individual party. IP-NFTs that are minted from within the Molecule ecosystem must carry an [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) compatible message with a personal signature. We refer to this structure as `TermsSig.` It proves that a party has agreed to terms shown on a website or mentioned in legal contracts.\n\nA `TermsSig` V1 contains the following information\n\n*   a \"banner\"\n    \n*   a list of terms the minter has agreed to sign\n    \n*   a list of document hashes, keyed by their document type\n    \n*   a version indicator\n    \n*   the chain id on which this signature should be considered valid\n    \n\nExample:\n\n```\nI accept the IP-NFT minting terms\n\nI have read and agreed to the terms of the IP-NFT Assignment Agreement\nI understand that the IP-NFT represents legal rights to IP and data of the project in my Research Agreement\nI understand that this in an irreversible and publicly traceable transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain\nI understand this is beta software and agree to the Terms of Service and assume all risks of minting this IP-NFT\n\nSponsored Research Agreement Hash: bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\nAssignment Agreement Hash: bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\n\nVersion: 1\nChain ID: 5\n```\n\nYou can use any EIP-191 compatible [ecrecover](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/address/#utils-recoverAddress) function to prove who has signed these terms. Etherscan [comes with a dedicated feature](https://etherscan.io/verifySig/14176) to publicly prove messages and signatures to simplify this process.\n\n### \n\nVerify and sign off final metadata\n\nThere's no way for the IP-NFT contract to verify that the metadata one provides is valid. To ensure its formal validity and completeness, we're therefore running a service that's signing off valid metadata with a signature that must be presented to the `mintReservation` function. These are the accounts and service endpoints of signers trusted by the IP-NFT contracts:\n\nHere's a sample request\n\n```\nPOST https://mint.molecule.to/api/signoffMetadata\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"network\": \"homestead\",\n  \"minter\": \"0xcB0b20A55e188eD52F1af694e2a3bCb9e81e3911\",\n  \"to\": \"0xD920E60b798A2F5a8332799d8a23075c9E77d5F8\",\n  \"reservationId\": 2,\n  \"tokenURI\": \"ipfs://bafkreibkvbe5n4iub7jac4cuhlokmdpt6fkv64x4huhy3gvgpbjf6ggzpa\"\n}\n```\n\n*   `network` the network alias the IP-NFT is being minted on (`homestead` for mainnet)\n    \n*   `minter` the minter's account that has signed the terms included in the metadata\n    \n*   `tokenURI` the final, resolvable metadata URI\n    \n*   `to` the minting recipient address\n    \n*   `reservationId` the reservation id that's going to minted (becomes the IP-NFT id after mint)\n    \n\nThe signoff service will\n\n*   download the metadata from the provided `tokenURI` (which proves its availability)\n    \n*   check whether the metadata conforms to the IP-NFT metadata schema\n    \n*   checks whether the metadata's `terms_signature` recovers to the `minter` address\n    \n\nIf that's the case, it will sign `keccak256(minter, to, reservationId, tokenURI)` with an account the IP-NFT contract accepts as verifier and yield it as response.\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"tokenURI\": \"ipfs://bafkreibkvbe5n4iub7jac4cuhlokmdpt6fkv64x4huhy3gvgpbjf6ggzpa\",\n  \"authorization\": \"0x171e5282e55f178eb384723d6b9e52181cab154ecf399ff1940211a1b80f1c7f0590103a49ea47dca7c4d7667a7ab640f3e836141b32c06aeb8819daec2d673c1c\",\n  \"signer\": \"0x3d30452c48f2448764d5819a9a2b684ae2cc5acf\"\n}\n```\n\nThe response's `authorization` signature bytes are then provided as the IP-NFTs `mintReservation` function's authorization parameter\n\n## \n\nCall the mint function\n\nThe remaining final step to mint an IP-NFT is calling the smart contract's `mintReservation` function:\n\n```\nfunction mintReservation(\n  address to, \n  uint256 reservationId, \n  string calldata _tokenURI, \n  string calldata _symbol, \n  bytes calldata authorization\n) external payable override whenNotPaused returns (uint256)\n```\n\nwith the parameters:\n\n*   `to` the recipient of the new IP-NFT (e.g. a multisig wallet)\n    \n*   `reservationId` the reserved IP-NFT id as received by the initial call to `reserve()`\n    \n*   `_tokenURI` the URI that resolves to the metadata\n    \n*   `_symbol` a short symbol that identifies the IP-NFT and its derivatives\n    \n*   `authorization` a bytes encoded signature by the validation service\n    \n\nand a `value` of `0.001 ether`that deals as symbolic minting fee.\n\n## \n\nPutting it all together: The IP-NFT Minting Flow\n\nTo sum up, minting an IP-NFT technically requires the following steps:\n\n*   invoke the IP-NFT contract's `reserve()` function to reserve a token id\n    \n    *   get the reserved token id by parsing the method's event log or use the subgraph\n        \n    \n*   upload an image to a (de)centralised network of your choice\n    \n*   use the token id and the IP-NFT contract's address to create legal documents\n    \n*   compute a checksum over the original documents\n    \n*   optionally encrypt the documents with a Lit access control condition\n    \n*   assemble a metadata structure containing the file pointers, access control conditions, encrypted symmetric key and checksum\n    \n*   craft a `TermsSig` message, sign it off by the minting account and add it to the metadata\n    \n*   verify that the metadata validates against the publicly known IPNFT schema\n    \n*   upload the metadata to a (de)centralised network of your choice\n    \n*   call the molecule validation service with your metadata URI to sign it off\n    \n*   invoke `mintReservation` on the IP-NFT contract",

If you are minting the IP-NFT to a different wallet, make sure to double check the wallet address. After minting, this target address will be the IP-NFT holder, and is the legal assignee of the Research Agreement.

We strongly recommend that you have a clear understanding of who controls any piece of IP that you want to mint into an IP-NFT. \nOne way to mitigate this risk is to transfer to the IP-NFT into a single legal entity co-managed by several people, e.g. a Series LLC minted on Wrappr. By using a wrapper corporation that sets forth clear terms and conditions regarding IP control and housing the IP in an IP-NFT, many of the traditional risks of IP control can be avoided. \nAnother way to mitigate this risk is to mint IPTs from the IP-NFT using our model FAM agreement, distributing control to a group of members in an IP commons, an approach we designed for the future of DeSci and described in the \"What are FAM?\" section of these docs. \nRisks of DAOs\nThere is risk stemming from regulatory uncertainty as applies to DAOs. For example, are DAOs general partnerships? Is there a way to limit personal liability from the risks involved in participating in a DAO? Is holding an IP-NFT in a DAO impute liability to DAO token holders?\nThese risks can be mitigated by using liability-limitation devices called DAO wrappers. Entities like Otoco or Wrappr are experimenting with ways to limit liability for crypto wallet holders, such as minting Series LLCs or UNAs to DAO wallets, and funds like a16z provide guidelines on DAO features and entity selection. \nRisks of Securities\nThere is a risk that IP-NFTs or their IPTs, if sold in a certain way, could be considered securities. \nAn excellent analysis of securities laws as they apply to tokens can be found here, in The Ineleuctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets are Not Securities, by DLx Law. A major takeaway from it is this: there is a difference between the asset itself, e.g. a fungible crypto token or an orange grove and the offering or sale of that asset. The asset, whether a token or an orange grove, may not be a security, but the offering, whether an initial coin offering (ICO) or an advertisement for shares of future profits from the orange grove, likely is a security. \nIn the USA and EU, securities offerings are subject to disclosure rules and procedural requirements depending on the size of the offerings and the kinds of people who can participate in them. These rules are not hard to follow, so you should learn about them and follow them when and where needed in order to mitigate risk. \nTo learn about the rules and guidelines for securities compliance in the USA, EU, or any particular country, consult a local lawyer in that country before selling any tokens there.",

Entities like [Otoco](https://otoco.io/) or [Wrappr](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/www.wrappr.wtf) are experimenting with ways to limit liability for crypto wallet holders, such as minting Series LLCs or UNAs to DAO wallets, and funds like a16z provide guidelines on [DAO features and entity selection](https://a16z.com/2022/05/23/dao-legal-frameworks-entity-features-selection/).\n\n## \n\nRisks of Securities\n\nThere is a risk that IP-NFTs or their IPTs, if sold in a certain way, could be considered securities.\n\nAn excellent analysis of securities laws as they apply to tokens can be found here, in [The Ineleuctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets are Not Securities](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4282385), by DLx Law. A major takeaway from it is this: there is a difference between the asset itself, e.g. a fungible crypto token or an orange grove and the offering or sale of that asset. The asset, whether a token or an orange grove, may not be a security, but the offering, whether an initial coin offering (ICO) or an advertisement for shares of future profits from the orange grove, likely is a security.\n\nIn the USA and EU, securities offerings are subject to disclosure rules and procedural requirements depending on the size of the offerings and the kinds of people who can participate in them. These rules are not hard to follow, so you should learn about them and follow them when and where needed in order to mitigate risk.\n\nTo learn about the rules and guidelines for securities compliance in the USA, EU, or any particular country, consult a local lawyer in that country before selling any tokens there.",

Among these, the CrowdSale.sol, LockingCrowdsale.sol, and StakedLockingCrowdsale.sol are Ethereum smart contracts that provide unique fundraising mechanisms, particularly suitable for funding scientific research.\nUnderstanding Ethereum Smart Contracts\nBefore we delve into specifics, let's briefly define an Ethereum smart contract. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They automate transactions and eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing cost and increasing transparency.\nCrowdSale.sol\nCrowdSale.sol is the fundamental contract that enables the creation of a crowdsale, which is a fundraising mechanism where individuals contribute ERC20 tokens in return for dIPs of a project.\nThink of this as a digital variant of traditional fundraising, where instead of getting a thank-you note or a freebie, contributors receive tokens that might have utility in the project's ecosystem, or even represent shares in an organization.\nUse Case in Scientific Research:\nScientific research can propose a project, define the number of tokens up for sale, the price per token, and the duration of the sale. Supporters of the project can purchase these tokens, effectively funding the research.\nLockingCrowdsale.sol\nLockingCrowdsale.sol extends the capabilities of CrowdSale.sol by adding a locking mechanism to the tokens purchased during the crowdsale. This means that the tokens contributors receive are \"locked\" for a certain period, and cannot be transferred or sold until the lock expires.\nUse Case in Scientific Research:\nThis can be particularly useful in scientific research as it ensures that contributors (token holders) are committed to the project for a certain duration. It can help to avoid quick sell-offs and stabilize the project's token economy.\nStakedLockingCrowdsale.sol\nStakedLockingCrowdsale.sol adds another layer of complexity and control. Here, in addition to the purchase, contributors also need to stake (lock up as collateral) a certain amount of another token to participate in the crowdsale. These staked tokens may also be vested over time, providing an added incentive for contributors to remain engaged with the project over a longer period.\nUse Case in Scientific Research:\nFor instance, a research project could require that contributors not only purchase project tokens but also stake a certain amount of a specific token (like a governance token of the research platform). This would ensure the contributors have a sustained interest in the project's success. The staked tokens could be returned over time, potentially with interest or rewards, further incentivizing long-term involvement.\nVITA-FAST Example\nAlice and Bob place bids in a crowdsale of VITA-FAST IPTs. The crowdsale has a 2-day Sale Period. The total bids (20 ETH) exceeded the Fundraise Goal (16 ETH), so the refunds (4 ETH + 4,000 VITA) are returned after the Sale Period ends and the crowdsale is settled. Because VITA is the Staked Token for this crowdsale, only the amount of VITA locked can be bid in the crowdsale. Refunds are given pro rata at the conclusion of the Sale Period; Alice's bid (15 ETH) was three times Bob's bid (5 ETH), so her refund (3 ETH + 3,000 VITA) is three times Bob's (1 ETH + 1,000 VITA). After settlement, allocations of IPTs can be claimed, but are locked (non-transferrable) for the duration of the 60-day Locking Period. After the Locking Period, Locked IPTs and vested VITA (vVITA) can be unlocked, making them transferrable.\nConclusion\nBy employing such contracts, scientific research projects can create a community of contributors and, through staking and vesting mechanisms, encouraged to stay involved over time. This can provide a robust and committed source of funding, contributing significantly to the advancement of a research project.",

This guide aims to explain how you can participate in this process and what it means for your donation.\nWhat is a crowdsale?\nA crowdsale is similar to a crowdfunding campaign, but instead of giving a donation, you purchase tokens associated with the project. These tokens could have various uses, depending on the project. For instance, they could allow you to vote on future directions or provide access to services.\nHow to Participate\nStep 1 · Make a bid\nYou'll need to stake and lock Staked Tokens to submit a bid in the auction for IPTs, which are governance tokens of an IP-NFT. Importantly, your bid amount cannot exceed the value of Staked Tokens you're willing to stake.\nThe more you bid, the larger your final allocation of IPTs will be, should the sale be successful (meeting its fundraising goal). If the auction is unsuccessful (doesn’t meet its fundraising goal), then all of your tokens can be claimed as a refund.\nStep 2 · Claim Tokens and Refunds\nIf the sale is successful then your bid will be settled pro rata. This means your final allocation of IPTs will depend on your bid's proportion to the total amount bid.\nAfter the sale period, visit the page where the sale took place (or access the corresponding smart contract directly). Here, you'll be able to claim your allocation of IPTs and any overflowed bid tokens.\nThe IPTs you purchase will be vesting along with the Staked Tokens you staked when you made your bid. You'll receive a vesting token, which is non-transferable and allows you to participate in governance, until you claim the vested IPTs and Staked Tokens.\nStep 3 · Unlock Tokens\nOnce the vesting period is over, return to the sale page to claim your tokens.\nHere, you'll be able to swap your vesting Staked Tokens (vVITA) for Staked Tokens (VITA) and your vesting IPTs for vested IPTs.\nParticipating in an auction for IPTs is an opportunity to support projects you believe in, but please make sure you understand the process and the risks involved by reading the documentation of the original project, and don't hesitate to ask for help on Discord if you have any questions.\nDefinitions\nWhat does \"Locking\" mean?\nWhen you participate in a traditional crowdsale, you can usually do whatever you want with the tokens you've purchased, including selling them. In a LockingCrowdsale, your purchased tokens are \"locked\" for a specified period of time. This means you can't sell or transfer them until the lock-up period ends.\nLocking is designed to ensure a stable environment for the project's growth and discourage \"pump-and-dump\" tactics, where people buy tokens only to sell them once their price increases.\nWhat does \"Staked\" mean?\nIn a StakedLockingCrowdsale, participants are required to \"stake\" an additional type of token to be eligible to participate in the Crowdsale. Staking is like placing tokens in a digital safe. You still own them, but they are locked away for a specified time.\nThe requirement to stake tokens adds another layer of commitment. It shows you believe in the project's long-term success since you're willing to temporarily lock away additional tokens.",

This means you can't sell or transfer them until the lock-up period ends.\n\nLocking is designed to ensure a stable environment for the project's growth and discourage \"pump-and-dump\" tactics, where people buy tokens only to sell them once their price increases.\n\n### \n\nWhat does \"Staked\" mean?\n\nIn a StakedLockingCrowdsale, participants are required to \"stake\" an additional type of token to be eligible to participate in the Crowdsale. Staking is like placing tokens in a digital safe. You still own them, but they are locked away for a specified time.\n\nThe requirement to stake tokens adds another layer of commitment. It shows you believe in the project's long-term success since you're willing to temporarily lock away additional tokens.",

If you are unfamiliar with IP-NFTs or IP Tokens, we highly recommend you read over those sections before proceeding. This guide will go over the logistics required to tokenize an IP-NFT, and for further information on the technical protocol, please read here. \nTokenizing an IP-NFT into IP Tokens enables the IP rights to be decentralized directly to individuals (IP Token Holders). The IP Token holders hold rights over the research, as granted by the IPT Membership Agreement, and selling IP Tokens via a Crowdsale is an effective way to raise funding for the research.\nData Room: Coordinate with the research lead to create a data room. Here is an example data room from VITA-FAST, the tokenization of the VitaDAO IP-NFT supporting Viktor Korolchuk's research at the University of Newcastle. Ensure all the data included in the data room is blinded or obfuscated to minimize the risk of IP leakage. \nWhitepaper: The Whitepaper describes the project in detail, and includes items like the project's background, research plans, risks, budget, timelines, tokenomics, and disclaimers. It is meant to have broad coverage for the curious funder interested in understanding the project deeply. Example whitepapers can be found here and here.\nPitch Deck: The data room should contain a pitch deck to summarize the research program, showing (blinded) data generated to date, and plans for future research. This pitch deck is likely the most important piece of collateral to be created in preparation for the IP Token Crowdsale.\nPresentation: We recommend a video recording to go along with the pitch deck, to educate the community about the research.\nAsk-me-anything (AMA): After the Presentation has been released, a community call for funders to engage directly with the researcher may be useful as an efficient means of getting the diligence questions answered. \nLab Tour: Though not required, a lab tour is an effective way to bring the community closer to your lab and research. We suggest highlighting the work and team that will be funded, as well as the instruments that will be used to conduct experiments.\nPress Release: For maximum reach, we recommend a press release in collaboration between the DAO, the university technology transfer office, and the researcher. Examples are here and here. \nResearcher Wallet: If the researcher will be receiving IP Tokens, those tokens will need to be held in a wallet connected to the Ethereum blockchain. We suggest holding them in a non-custodial wallet such as Metamask or Rabby. You will have to share your wallet address (0x...) with the DAO so they can send the IP tokens to the correct wallet.\nFresh Multi-signature Wallet: Though optional, a DAO may choose to create a separate multi-signature wallet for the tokenized IP-NFT to keep all assets project-specific. SAFE is typically the multi-signature wallet of choice.\nSnapshot Space and ENS Domain: In order to use IP Tokens for governance, you will need to create a Snapshot space (guide here). Importantly, an ENS domain will need to be registered and granted to the appropriate multi-signature wallet controlling the Snapshot space.\nResearch Organization Checklist\nGet approval: Whether you are working with a university or a private lab, legal approval for IP tokenization is the first requirement. To help de-risk the opportunity with the research organization, the following articles may be useful collateral for convincing key decision makers.\nResearch Organization Wallet: If the research agreement between the DAO and the research organization states that the research organization has an ownership stake in any IP that comes from the research, then the research organization should expect to receive IP tokens. The IP tokens will need to be held in a wallet connected to the Ethereum blockchain. We suggest holding them in a multi-signature wallet such as SAFE. You will have to share your wallet address (0x...) with the DAO so they can send the IP tokens to the correct wallet.\nPress Release: For maximum reach, we recommend a press release in collaboration between the DAO, the university technology transfer office, and the researcher. Examples are here and here. \nParticipate in Governance: In order to use your tokens for governance, you will need to connect with the DAO to find the proper Snapshot space, where governance will take place. Here is specific guide on how to participate in voting with Snapshot. \nFAQs\nQ: Is ownership of the IP/results defined wholly by who controls the wallet the IP-NFT is in?\nA: The scenario of multiple IP owners presents complex challenges. In order to streamline this process, there is a singular owner designated as the holder of the IP-NFT, who is responsible for the distribution of governance rights pertaining to the licensing function of the IP. This strategy ensures a more efficient and less convoluted management of IP rights and licenses.\nQ: The future model involves scientists directly minting and selling IP-NFTs to raise research funds – how will this work where IP belongs to the institution and not the individual scientist?\nSo long as research happens at universities or private labs, that is where the IP must be licensed. Even in the case that a researcher is being funded directly, a legal entity is the likely owner and counter-party for any IP licensing agreements. \nQ: What due diligence will be in place to ensure the party minting an IP-NFT has rights to transfer ownership?\nThis is the burden of the licensee. However, validating IP ownership and ensuring the IP is truly owned by the minter of an IP-NFT is a service that can be provided by Molecule. Until IP is enforced entirely on the blockchain, there will always have to be some degree of manual diligence required.\nQ: If sending the IP-NFT to another party, does the other party need to sign some sort of agreement in addition to just holding the IP-NFT in a wallet they control to take full legal ownership?\nJust holding the IP-NFT is sufficient to be assigned the rights to the IP. That said, an unlawful transfer (e.g. someone steals the IP-NFT) would still be invalid.",
