The **Research Agreement** states the rights of the asset holder (dataset, future IP, etc.) and the price paid for the asset. In our case, these agreements are often lined out as Sponsored Research Agreements (SRAs) but they could be any other kind of legal agreement. \n  2. **Access the**[**Molecule IP-NFT Minting Front-End**](https://mint.molecule.to)[Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/). \n  3. **Connect your wallet** The first thing you will need to do to mint an IP-NFT is connect a wallet. It is important that this wallet is an [externally-owned account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) (EOA) and not a smart contract wallet, such as a Gnosis Multisig. This is to ensure your Research Agreement can be encrypted with a private key prior to pinning on decentralized storage. \n  4. **Reserve an IP-NFT** The process starts by reserving a TokenID on the IP-NFT contract. This TokenID will be used to let our access control infrastructure know that only the owner of the TokenID should have access to the data behind the NFT. \n  5. **Project Details** Add information about your IP-NFT. All information in this step will be saved in the metadata of the IP-NFT and will be publicly available. Importantly, all information specified is immutable after an IP-NFT has been minted, so make sure that the information you provide is correct. \n  6. **Research Agreement** Upload the Research Agreement mentioned in Step 1, and add Contract Title, Signature Date, Contract Owner (Assignor), and Contract Type. It is important that these data elements match what is represented in the Research Agreement, and are referenced in the Assignment Agreement in the next step. The Research Agreement will be encrypted, so don't worry if it has confidential information. \n  7. **Assignment Agreement** This agreement assigns the rights of the Research Agreement (Step 6) to the holder of the IP-NFT. Sign your legal name, specify the organization you are assigning the rights to (DAO name), and specify the target wallet address (default is the connected wallet). If you are minting the IP-NFT to a different wallet, make sure to double check the wallet address. \n  8. **Artwork** Upload an image to commemorate the research. This image will be public, so please follow the content guidelines and upload appropriate images. \n  9. **Review your IP-NFT data** Review the data submitted for the IP-NFT. Once ready, continue the process. After submitting your data in this step, the Research Agreement will be encrypted and uploaded to the decentralized data storage. The decryption key will be stored with Lit Protocol to manage access control based on the NFT ownership. You will be able to download this key at any time to access your files as long as you control the IP-NFT. \n  10. **Sign IP-NFT minting transaction** Your wallet will pop-up and ask you to sign your agreement to the minting terms and to sign the minting transaction that creates the IP-NFT. A symbolic minting fee (0.001 ETH / ~2 USD) required to counter spam attacks on the protocol. \n  11. **View your IP-NFT in Portfolio:** Once the transaction is finalized on chain you will find an IP-NFT in your wallet. Congrats! You just created an IP-NFT and brought legal rights on-chain!\n\n\n[PreviousWhy mint an IP-NFT?](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/why-mint-an-ip-nft)[NextTechnical Components of IP-NFTs](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts)\nLast updated 1 year ago\n",

Your wallet will serve as your _identity_ for idea registration.\n  2. **Present your Invention** Drop your invention as digital files—these can include docs, sketches or images, code, or other formats. The content of your idea remains private and secure, as it is not uploaded to any service. You are simply presenting your confidential files.\n  3. **Create a timestamped proof** After presenting your digital files, the system generates a unique hash and anchors it on-chain, creating a transaction that links your idea to your wallet. This hash serves as an immutable record of your invention, timestamped to the exact moment of creation. The proof cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of your invention.\n  4. **Verify ownership** When needed, you can easily prove to the system and to others ownership of the invention by revealing only a portion of the proof (e.g., a specific file), without disclosing the entire set of files or original content. This allows you to maintain confidentiality while validating your claim to the invention. It’s important to keep an original and exact copy of the files you presented to prove that you are the original creator.\n  5. **Mint an IP-NFT (Optional)** If you decide to take the next step in protecting your idea, you can mint an IPNFT from a Proof of Invention (PoI). This IP-NFT will ensure you have legitimate ownership over Intellectual Property rights associated with your idea, enabling you to tokenize your intellectual property and engage in future transactions or collaborations. \n\n\n**Important Note:** Proof of Invention (PoI) is complementary to the existing patent system but does not serve as a provisional patent or patent application. While PoI can ensure the originality of your idea compare to preview ideas registered in the app, it does not guarantee the novelty or patentability of the idea. No content is disclosed during the process, meaning the novelty cannot be assessed, and prior art searches cannot be performed. If you wish to confirm the novelty of your idea or protect your idea through a patent, we recommend consulting with a patent professional to explore traditional patent filing options.\n[![Logo](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmolecule.xyz%2Ffavicon.ico%3Ffavicon.8526f363.ico&width=20&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=6253e8dc&sv=2)Your inventions on-chain | Molecule | MoleculeMolecule](https://poi.molecule.xyz/)\n[PreviousIntro to Proof of Invention (PoI)](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/proof-of-invention-poi/intro-to-proof-of-invention-poi)[NextAPI Access (Beta)](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/proof-of-invention-poi/api-access-beta)\nLast updated 9 months ago\n",

[🧑‍🔬IP Tokens](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens)\n\n\n#  ✨How to tokenize IPTs from an IP-NFT?\nThe process of minting IP Tokens from an IP-NFT.\nCreating IPTs from an IP-NFT on testnet.\nThe `Tokenizer` is a smart contract enabling IP-NFT owners to create a tailored IPT ERC20 contract. Think of it as a cryptographic key that unlocks fractional rights associated with an IP-NFT - a significant stride towards a future of decentralized IP management. \nThe `Tokenizer` is a smart contract that mints IPTs from an IP-NFT. IP-NFTs are processed through the `Tokenizer` to produce IPTs, marking a transformative step towards a decentralized future of IP management.\nIPTs have various functional groups; they can effectuate distributed governance, grant access to privileged and proprietary data, and IP licensing. Though these reactive capacities aren't necessarily inherent to all IP-NFT contracts, they can be configured via IPT-weighted governance. Much like how researchers experiment with many molecules to discover cures for a particular disease, IPTs are meant to be experimented with to discover the cure for apathy and scientific stagnation.\nBy executing the `Tokenizer:tokenizeIpnft` function, an IP-NFT owner initializes the creation of a new `IPToken` ERC20 contract with an initial supply. This is akin to sparking a digital forge, producing a minimal clone of the current `IPToken` implementation and appointing the Tokenizer contract as its owner. It's the conductor leading the symphony of code.\nAn `IPToken` contract's owner has the authority to mint an arbitrary supply of IPTs via its `issue` function. However, token holders need to be aware of possible dilution at the discretion of the IP-NFT holder - it's a little like adding water to a concentrated solution. New emissions are managed by the governance layer overseeing the multi-signature wallet retaining the IP-NFT.\nAn original owner can designate a IPTs contract as capped, effectively disabling an further increase of supply. This condition can be queried by other clients, like a potential sales share distribution contract for that token.\nWhile the initial distribution of IPTs to other accounts falls outside the `Tokenizer`'s remit, IPT holders retain the freedom to transfer their tokens at will and without any charge.\nFor certain privileges, IPT holders might need to agree to a legal document provided during the tokenization transaction. Stored as IPFS CIDs within their `Metadata` structure, these agreements, while not intrinsic to IPTs, act as legal guardrails enforced by other system components, such as the `TermsAcceptedPermissioner`.\nAnd there you have it, a sophisticated fusion of technology and law, setting the stage for a more democratic and accessible future in IP management. \nThe Tokenizer contract is deployed on\nmainnet: `0x58EB89C69CB389DBef0c130C6296ee271b82f436`\ngörli: `0xb12494eeA6B992d0A1Db3C5423BE7a2d2337F58c`\n[PreviousWhat are IP Tokens?](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts)[NextHow to buy or trade IPTs](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/how-to-buy-or-trade-ipts)\nLast updated 1 year ago\n",

This timestamp acts as verifiable evidence, inventors can later mint an IP-NFT from their Proof of Invention (PoI) generating an inmutable record and establish legitimate ownership of their invention. \n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/proof-of-invention-poi/intro-to-proof-of-invention-poi#purpose)\n**Purpose**\n  * **For early-stage inventors** : PoI is ideal for inventors and researchers who need a secure, low-cost way to document their ideas before sharing them with others, without dealing with the high costs and formalities of provisional patents.\n  * **For scientific communities like BioDAOs** : PoI helps them find, recognize and reward the best ideas of their community members, giving recognition and incentive to their original inventors. \n  * **Facilitates IP Tokenization** : If the inventor decides to pursue further protection, the on-chain proof can be used later in the IP-NFT minting process, enabling tokenization of their intellectual property.\n  * **Compatible with traditional IP systems** : PoI aligns with existing IP systems, allowing inventors to use it as evidence when filing patents or presenting their idea in legal proceedings.\n\n\n![](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3275698018-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FzdcuGmESNyqrbymueqNW%252Fuploads%252FIHEeQ9pQc1IAn8c3CSgh%252FFrom_IP_to.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Ded87f63f-e528-4d11-92cf-c9e1037375ee&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=18b167cd&sv=2)\n[![Logo](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.prod.website-files.com%2F5fcf058ca5a742c36f247ef0%2F60af728621134d972548adff_Molecule%2520Webclip.png&width=20&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=bc6223e6&sv=2)Quick Start Guide to Registering Your Proof of Invention (PoI)www.molecule.to](https://www.molecule.to/blog/quick-start-guide-to-registering-your-proof-of-invention)\n[PreviousWhy Molecule?](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/introduction/why-molecule)[NextHow to register inventions?](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/proof-of-invention-poi/how-to-register-inventions)\nLast updated 6 months ago\n",

The two legal contracts involved are the (a) Research Agreement (Sponsored Research Agreement) and (b) Assignment Agreement. The Assignment Agreement assigns the Research Agreement to the owner of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), thereby transforming the NFT into an IP-NFT​​. \n**The Sponsored Research Agreement:**\nThis agreement is entered into between the researcher and the sponsor or funder of the research, granting IP and R&D data rights to the sponsor in exchange for research funding. It outlines:\n  * Scope of Work: The specific research activities to be conducted.\n  * Deliverables: The expected outputs of the research.\n  * Timeline: The schedule for the research project.\n  * Budget: The financial plan for the project.\n\n\nThe Sponsored Research Agreement ensures also that the research is conducted according to the sponsor's requirements and includes provisions for confidentiality, intellectual property rights, data ownership, and the publication of results. It may also include terms for any licenses or patents resulting from the research and may sponsor related activities such as overheads costs, conferences and workshops. \n**The Assignment Agreement:** This agreement assigns the contractual position in the Sponsored Research Agreement to the owner of the NFT. It acts as a bridge between the legal contract and the smart contract, bringing the IP and R&D data rights on-chain. The Assignment Agreement includes a crucial clause that ensures the rights attached to the IP-NFT are transferred to a new owner:\nAssignment Agreement example available in the[ Molecule Github](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/Legal-Contracts). \n[PreviousIntro to IP-NFT](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/intro-to-ip-nft)[NextWhy mint an IP-NFT?](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/why-mint-an-ip-nft)\nLast updated 1 year ago\n",

Runnable versions of the code samples depicted in this article can be found in the accompanying [samples repo](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/ipnft-samples).\n## \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#non-fungible-tokens-in-a-nutshell)\nNon Fungible Tokens in a Nutshell\nNon fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/)) are smart contract based assets that associate a unique token identifier with the blockchain address of its respective owner. The underlying smart contract defines rules on how they are minted (brought into existence), transferred, or burned (destroyed). It also can restrict their ability to be transferred or offer features that are unlocked for individual token holders.\nIP-NFTs use the common [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) NFT standard with minting, burning and metadata extensions. The IP-NFT collection contract is deployed on Mainnet and on Görli Testnet, you can find the addresses [here](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/smart-contract-addresses). Each token's metadata is stored as a file descriptor URI (e.g. `ar://HxXKCIE0skR4siRNYeLKI61Vwg_TJ5PJTbxQmtO0EPo`) that must be resolved client side, e.g. by using decentralized storage network gateways ([Arweave](https://arweave.news/introduction-to-the-most-important-infrastructure-in-the-ar-ecosystem-ar-gateway/) or [IPFS](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/)). The contract is non-enumerable, i.e. users can't simply query their owned assets on-chain but instead must rely on reading the respective event logs to build their own off-chain state. We've deployed TheGraph subgraphs [on mainnet](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/moleculeprotocol/ip-nft-mainnet) and [on Görli](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/elmariachi111/schrotti-galoppi-schmacko-1/graphql) that can be queried for asset ownership and other IP-NFT related information.\nRead more about [TheGraph, subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/#what-the-graph-is) and [how to query them](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/) from your application.\nHere's a GraphQL example of how to query IP-NFT data from the subgraph:\nCopy```\nquery IPNFTsOf($owner: ID!)\n{\n  ipnfts(where: {owner: $owner}) {\n    id\n    owner\n    createdAt\n    tokenURI\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVariables:\nCopy```\n{\n  \"owner\": \"0xf7990cd398dafb4fe5fd6b9228b8e6f72b296555\"\n}\n```\n\nResult:\nCopy```\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"ipnfts\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"2\",\n        \"owner\": \"0xf7990cd398dafb4fe5fd6b9228b8e6f72b296555\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"1686582803\",\n        \"tokenURI\": \"ipfs://bafkreig274nfj7srmtnb5wd5wlwm3ig2s63wovlz7i3noodjlfz2tm3n5q\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe've deployed the contracts as [UUPS proxies](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable) owned by the [Molecule developer team's multisig](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth:0xCfA0F84660fB33bFd07C369E5491Ab02C449f71B), thus the contract you're interacting with and the contract that contains the current logic are different. Make sure to always invoke functions on the UUPS proxy - its official addresses can be found [here](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/smart-contract-addresses). The implementation contracts have been verified on Etherscan, so you can [easily retrieve their ABIs](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b179dffac5e190c670176606f552cb792847f80#code).\n## \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#reserve-an-ip-nft-token-id)\nReserve an IP-NFT Token ID\nIP-NFTs can generally be minted by any account. The first step on the minting journey is to reserve an IP-NFT token id by calling the IP-NFT contract's `reserve()` method. This capturing step is necessary because the legal documents attached to the final IP-NFT are referring to the NFT's token id that only becomes available after the mint has occurred. Minters will use the token id to craft the legal documents that outline the rights and obligations of owning that NFT in the real world. \nWhen minting an IP-NFT using the molecule frontend, the reserved token id will be inserted in the autogenerated Assignment Agreement. If you're minting IP-NFTs on your own, make sure to correctly mention them in your legal attachments. A selection of premade contract templates for IP-NFTs can be found [on Github](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/Legal-Contracts).\n## \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#assemble-and-upload-metadata)\nAssemble and Upload Metadata\nThe JSON metadata documents behind IP-NFTs are required to strictly validate against a [well defined JSON schema that's](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeihvql52zxnkksedcad5i6ptimpquu4oiek56ojldkm3ndkfoevmf4/ipnft.schema.json) flexible enough to cover many relevant use cases. [Here's a visual tool](https://jsonschema.dev/s/ciB7W) to investigate a valid IP-NFT's metadata interactively. Note that the generic fields `name`, `image` and `description` are located on the document's root level, whereas the `agreements` and `project_details` structures are modelled as rich property definitions.\nCopy```\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"name\": \"Our awesome test IP-NFT\",\n  \"description\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...\",\n  \"image\": \"ar://7De6dRLDaMhMeC6Utm9bB9PRbcvKdi-rw_sDM8pJSMU\",\n  \"external_url\": \"https://testnet.mint.molecule.to/ipnft/76\",\n  \"terms_signature\": \"0x...\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"type\": \"IP-NFT\",\n    \"agreements\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"License Agreement\",\n        \"url\": \"ar://4FG3GR8qCdLo923tVBC85NTYHaaAc3TvCsF3aZwum_o\",\n        \"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\",\n        \"content_hash\": \"bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\",\n      }\n    ],\n    \"project_details\": {\n      \"industry\": \"Space Exploration\",\n      \"organization\": \"NASA\",\n      \"topic\": \"Wormholes\",\n      \"funding_amount\": {\n        \"value\": 123456789,\n        \"decimals\": 2,\n        \"currency\": \"USD\",\n        \"currency_type\": \"ISO4217\"\n      },\n      \"research_lead\": {\n        \"name\": \"Carl Sagan\",\n        \"email\": \"carl@example.com\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#validate-metadata-correctness)\nValidate Metadata Correctness\nTo validate IP-NFT metatadata documents against that schema, you can use arbitrary JSON schema tools. [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/guide/getting-started.html) is one of the most powerful ones in Javascript. We're omitting [the code](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/ipnft-samples/blob/main/verifyMetadata.mts) to retrieve schema or documents for brevity's sake but in a nutshell validation boils down to:\nCopy```\nimport Ajv from \"ajv\";\nimport addFormats from \"ajv-formats\";\n\n(async () => {\n  const ipnftSchema = JSON.parse(ipnftSchemaJson);\n  const document = JSON.parse(ipnftMetadataJson);\n\n  const ajv = new Ajv();\n  addFormats(ajv);\n  const validateIpnft = ajv.compile(ipnftSchema);\n  const validationResult = validateIpnft(document);  \n})();\n```\n\n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#link-to-external-resources)\nLink to External Resources\nIP-NFT metadata documents require you to refer to external resources, e.g. the `image` or `agreements[].url` fields. While you can choose to go with the well known `https://` protocol, it's advisable to use web3-native decentralized storage pointers like `ar://` or `ipfs://` instead. Clients are supposed to resolve them to their respective http gateway counterparts and most NFT related services and frontends can handle them. You don't need to run an Arweave or IPFS node yourself - [Ardrive](https://app.ardrive.io) or web3.storage are excellent helper services that get the job done and our official IP-NFT minting UI uses web3.storage to publish IPFS documents to a reliable storage backend and automatically create storage deals on Filecoin.\nHere's a nodejs example on how to upload a JSON document using web3.storage (it's simpler to do this [within a browser context](https://web3.storage/docs/how-tos/store/#preparing-files-for-upload), though):\nCopy```\nimport dotenv from \"dotenv\";\nimport { Blob } from \"node:buffer\";\nimport { Web3Storage } from \"web3.storage\";\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst w3sClient = new Web3Storage({ token: process.env.W3S_TOKEN });\n\n(async () => {\n  const content = {\n    uploaded_at: new Date().toISOString(),\n  };\n\n  const binaryContent = new Blob([JSON.stringify(content)], {\n    type: \"application/json\",\n  });\n\n  const file = {\n    name: \"filename.json\",\n    stream: () => binaryContent.stream(),\n  };\n\n  //@ts-ignore\n  const cid = await w3sClient.put([file], {\n    name: \"some.json\",\n    wrapWithDirectory: false,\n  });\n  console.log(cid);\n})();\n```\n\nresults in an IPFS CIDv1:\nCopy```\nbafkreicrhuxfzrydht6tmd4kyy6pkbhspqthswg6xbiqlaztmf774ojxhq\n```\n\nTo resolve the published content, you can request it from any public IPFS http gateway. You'll experience the lowest latency when querying a gateway close to the node that you used for uploading; web3.storage offers `https://w3s.link` for that purpose. Requesting <https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafkreicrhuxfzrydht6tmd4kyy6pkbhspqthswg6xbiqlaztmf774ojxhq> yields\nCopy```\n{\"uploaded_at\":\"2023-01-02T22:45:17.788Z\"}\n```\n\n## \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#decentralized-encryption-and-ip-nft-token-gating)\nDecentralized Encryption and IP-NFT Token Gating\nAn IP-NFT's most important metadata property are its `agreements`, another term for legal documents attached to it. These documents refer to the IP-NFT smart contract's (\"collection\") address and the IP-NFT's token id. The agreements' content might contain confidential information about the involved parties and hence should be encrypted before being uploaded. Decentralized and permissionless encryption is a non trivial requirement that we solve by relying on [Lit Protocol](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/Explanation/encryption).\nLit runs a network of nodes that derive signing and encryption keys by multiparty computation / threshold cryptography on trusted computing enclaves. The nodes themselves only know parts of the private key that effectively is fully assembled on the client side after all conditions for key retrieval have been met. Lit protocol allows gating any content behind access control conditions that are backed by blockchain state, therefore it's disclosing decryption keys only to holders of an NFT or users that meet a certain condition on chain.\n[Lit's documentation](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/Explanation/encryption#encrypting) lays out the encryption process in detail. To instantiate a Lit SDK instance that's capable of encrypting or decrypting content, [it needs](https://developer.litprotocol.com/sdk/explanation/walletsigs/authsig/#obtaining-the-authsig) an [EIP-4361](https://login.xyz) compatible signature that proves control over the current user's account. Once authenticated we can request a new symmetric key to encrypt our content and ultimately ask the Lit network nodes to store its key shares along with an access control condition. That request yields an encrypted decryption key (😵‍💫) that has been created by the network nodes.\nCopy```\n  import LitJsSdk from '@lit-protocol/sdk-browser'\n  \n  const litClient = new LitJsSdk.LitNodeClient()\n  await client.connect() //connects to Lit network nodes\n\n  const file: Blob | File = //some file\n  const { encryptedFile, symmetricKey } = await LitJsSdk.encryptFile({ file })\n\n  //you can reuse a Siwe / EIP-4361 compatible signed message here, see https://login.xyz/\n  const authSig = await LitJsSdk.checkAndSignAuthMessage({ chain: \"ethereum\" });\n\n  accessControlConditions = {\n      conditionType: 'evmBasic',\n      contractAddress: tokenContractAddress,\n      standardContractType: 'ERC721',\n      chain: \"ethereum\",\n      method: 'ownerOf',\n      parameters: [tokenId],\n      returnValueTest: {\n        comparator: '=',\n        value: ':userAddress'\n      }\n    }\n\n  const u8encryptedSymmetricKey = await litClient.saveEncryptionKey({\n    unifiedAccessControlConditions: accessControlConditions,\n    symmetricKey,\n    authSig,\n    chain,\n    permanent: false\n  })\n  \n  \n```\n\nA user who wants to decrypt the content must again initialize the Lit SDK using a signed message that proves control over their address. Next, they ask several network nodes to present their key shares of the encrypted key by presenting the access control conditions and the encrypted symmetric key to the network. If the network nodes find that the account matches the given conditions, each one yields its key share for the encrypted decryption key. With that, the SDK decrypts the key the content has initially been encrypted with.\nCopy```\nconst authSig = await LitJsSdk.checkAndSignAuthMessage({ chain: \"ethereum\" });\nconst symmetricKey = await litClient.getEncryptionKey({\n    unifiedAccessControlConditions: accessControlConditions,\n    toDecrypt: encryptedSymmetricKey,\n    chain: \"ethereum\",\n    authSig\n})\n```\n\nAn IP-NFT metadata's `agreements` item can store the encrypted symmetric key and its access control conditions inside its `encryption` field. Note that the IP-NFT JSON schema of `access_control_conditions` is externally [defined by Lit protocol](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-accs-validator-sdk/tree/main/src/schemas).\nCopy```\n\"agreements\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"License Agreement\",\n    \"url\": \"ar://4FG3GR8qCdLo923tVBC85NTYHaaAc3TvCsF3aZwum_o\",\n    \"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\",\n    \"content_hash\": \"bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\",\n    \"encryption\": {\n      \"protocol\": \"lit\",\n      \"encrypted_sym_key\": \"fcbeaf3af31c7104d1d1f7099a6c6f6fda5803a4f7a0bef93256f3377450291872ad07bed3e9402cb47cc932c8f48219e56b84c06becd5ec0ee83ef2c0c93b932fb675c7932fa8df0ad164f17642b32415e382081577a403c19da2eff22c9083fa134ad1f370c2bec449adcdea790498637c7238b7d67cf2d69507a962656d3200000000000000205e4ad4e6323e06862babc934f740bc2e566d175a5da23bb4f1b35635e5cc3768cd040e8776307ea038484ff42033c18f\",\n      \"access_control_conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"conditionType\": \"evmBasic\",\n          \"contractAddress\": \"0xaf7358576C9F7cD84696D28702fC5ADe33cce0e9\",\n          \"standardContractType\": \"ERC721\",\n          \"chain\": \"goerli\",\n          \"method\": \"ownerOf\",\n          \"parameters\": [\n            \"6\"\n          ],\n          \"returnValueTest\": {\n            \"comparator\": \"=\",\n            \"value\": \":userAddress\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#using-multisig-wallet-signers)\nUsing Multisig Wallet Signers\nDue to the high value nature of IP-NFTs you might feel tempted to use a multisig wallet for the minting process, maybe because you'd like to prove that the IP-NFT has been created by a dedicated group of individuals. This works fine for all contract function invocations but is not supported by Lit protocol. Multisig wallets (or contract wallets to be precise) cannot sign messages in the way it's required to authenticate against Lit nodes because they're not based on a private key. This might once be possible by utilizing [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) compatible wallet signatures but [was not supported](https://discord.com/channels/896185694857343026/916383445784096839/1058018912010248232) earlier. We're going to add [support for it](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/Explanation/WalletSigs/authSig#how-to-structure-the-authsig) soon.\nThe recommended workaround is to denote a dedicated trusted member of the multisig that's supposed to intially own the minted IP-NFT. This could be the researcher, a core contributor or maintainer of the project. The IP-NFT contract's `mintReservation` function takes a recipient parameter (`to`) that defines the NFT's initial owner. Note, that the account that _invokes_ the mint function is required to hold a mint pass, not the receiver.\n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#granting-read-access-to-third-parties)\nGranting Read Access to Third Parties\nAnother shortcoming related to Lit's requirement of private key based authentication signatures is that multisig token holders cannot prove their address to the protocol. To allow multisig members to decrypt the accompanying agreement documents, the IP-NFT contract contains a [`grantReadAccess`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x36444254795ce6E748cf0317EEE4c4271325D92A#writeProxyContract#F3) function that can only be invoked by the current token holder (e.g. a multisig) to grant certain accounts (e.g. some of their members or potential buyers) read access to the underlying content for a limited amount of time. Its counterpart [`canRead`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x36444254795ce6E748cf0317EEE4c4271325D92A#readProxyContract#F3) yields a boolean whether the `reader` is currently allowed access. For the current owner of an IP-NFT this method always returns `true`.\nTo make read grants work inside Lit protocol, one can craft a [custom contract access control condition](https://developer.litprotocol.com/coreConcepts/accessControl/EVM/customContractCalls) that not only takes the current IP-NFT ownership into account but also lets users pass that currently are granted read access:\nCopy```\n\"encryption\": {\n  \"protocol\": \"lit\",\n  \"encrypted_sym_key\": \"...\",\n  \"access_control_conditions\": [\n    {\n      \"conditionType\": \"evmContract\",\n      //the IP-NFT UUPS proxy contract address\n      \"contractAddress\": \"0xaf7358576C9F7cD84696D28702fC5ADe33cce0e\",\n      \"chain\": \"goerli\",\n      \"functionName\": \"canRead\",\n      \"functionParams\": [\n        \":userAddress\",\n        \"10\"\n      ],\n      \"functionAbi\": {\n        \"name\": \"canRead\",\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"address\",\n            \"name\": \"reader\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\n            \"name\": \"tokenId\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"outputs\": [\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"bool\",\n            \"name\": \"\",\n            \"type\": \"bool\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"stateMutability\": \"view\",\n        \"type\": \"function\"\n      },\n      \"returnValueTest\": {\n        \"key\": \"\",\n        \"comparator\": \"=\",\n        \"value\": \"true\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#proving-content-integrity)\nProving Content Integrity\nSince agreement documents are encrypted before being stored, each agreement item may contain a `content_hash` that downloaders can use to prove the legal documents' content integrity after they've decrypted it. When using IPFS as storage layer this hash is not adding much value since the network's content ids already provide an untamperable way of guaranteeing content integrity, however [they're not derived from the original content](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/hashing/#content-identifiers-are-not-file-hashes) and hard to prove without an IPFS node at hand.\nThe `content_hash` field shall contain the sha-256 digest of the attachment's binary content, encoded as a multihash compatible to CIDv1. This allows users to decode the content hash and verify document's content without being aware of the hashing algorithm used. This is how it looks like in Typescript using the [multiformats NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multiformats):\nCopy```\nimport { CID } from \"multiformats/cid\";\nimport * as json from \"multiformats/codecs/json\";\nimport { sha256 } from \"multiformats/hashes/sha2\";\n\nconst checksum = async (u8: Uint8Array) => {\n  //https://multiformats.io/multihash/\n  const digest = await sha256.digest(u8);\n  return CID.create(1, json.code, digest);\n};\n\nconst verifyChecksum = async (\n  u8: Uint8Array,\n  _cid: string\n): Promise<boolean> => {\n  const cid = CID.parse(_cid);\n  //https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L9\n  console.log(\"hash algo used: 0x%s\", cid.multihash.code.toString(16));\n\n  const digest = await sha256.digest(u8);\n  return cid.multihash.bytes.every((el, i) => el === digest.bytes[i]);\n};\n\n(async () => {\n  const binaryContent = new TextEncoder().encode(\"This is the content\");\n  const cid = await checksum(binaryContent);\n  const valid = await verifyChecksum(binaryContent, cid.toString());\n  console.log(cid, valid);\n})();\n\n```\n\n## \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#terms-and-validation-signatures)\nTerms and Validation signatures \n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#sign-off-legal-terms-and-agreements-content)\nSign off legal terms and agreements' content\nSome of the attached legal PDF documents might contain a reference on being only valid when being digitally signed by an individual party. IP-NFTs that are minted from within the Molecule ecosystem must carry an [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) compatible message with a personal signature. We refer to this structure as `TermsSig.` It proves that a party has agreed to terms shown on a website or mentioned in legal contracts.\nA `TermsSig` V1 contains the following information\n  * a \"banner\"\n  * a list of terms the minter has agreed to sign\n  * a list of document hashes, keyed by their document type\n  * a version indicator\n  * the chain id on which this signature should be considered valid\n\n\nExample:\nCopy```\nI accept the IP-NFT minting terms\n\nI have read and agreed to the terms of the IP-NFT Assignment Agreement\nI understand that the IP-NFT represents legal rights to IP and data of the project in my Research Agreement\nI understand that this in an irreversible and publicly traceable transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain\nI understand this is beta software and agree to the Terms of Service and assume all risks of minting this IP-NFT\n\nSponsored Research Agreement Hash: bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\nAssignment Agreement Hash: bagaaiera7ftqs3jmnoph3zgq67bgjrszlqtxkk5ygadgjvnihukrqioipndq\n\nVersion: 1\nChain ID: 5\n```\n\nYou can use any EIP-191 compatible [ecrecover](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/address/#utils-recoverAddress) function to prove who has signed these terms. Etherscan [comes with a dedicated feature](https://etherscan.io/verifySig/14176) to publicly prove messages and signatures to simplify this process.\n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/technical-details-for-developers#verify-and-sign-off-final-metadata)\nVerify and sign off final metadata\nThere's no way for the IP-NFT contract to verify that the metadata one provides is valid.

[Learn more about the model.](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecule-protocol-v2-bridging-the-future-of-decentralized-science-into-rwas)\n\n\nThe model introduces a compliant hybrid structure—utility tokens enable early, global participation; IP and treasury are held onchain within a traditional corporation, making discoveries more fundable and enabling efficient movement from lab to clinic. \n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts#economic-rights)\nEconomic Rights:\nIPTs are utility tokens representing participation in a decentralized science community. Once escrowed, IPT holders may advise on project direction, but do not automatically receive economic or legal rights. \nContributors who wish to unlock a financial stake may apply to receive equity grants, thereby having an economic right in the proceeds of the intellectual property developed by the project. To unlock equity and binding governance, a holder must lock their tokens, complete KYC/AML, and execute a written equity agreement with the project. Shareholder rights then follow corporate law; holders who remain token-only participants retain tradeable credentials, not financial stakes. Revenue share and buybacks are always discretionary and ever conditional—not features of the token itself.\n[Learn more about the legal framework](https://www.molecule.to/blog/molecule-protocol-v2-bridging-the-future-of-decentralized-science-into-rwas).\nRead about the smart contracts for IPTs in our [Github repo](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/IPNFT/tree/main).\n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-ipts#the-role-of-ipts-in-decentralised-science-desci)\n**The Role of IPTs in Decentralised Science (DeSci)** :\nIn the decentralized science (DeSci) ecosystem, IPTs serve as a vital tool for enabling broader community involvement in scientific research. By tokenizing intellectual property, IPTs democratize access to and control over scientific advancements, fostering a transparent, collaborative environment where the community can contribute to and influence the development of cutting-edge therapies.\n[PreviousSmart Contract Addresses](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/technical-components-of-ip-nfts/smart-contract-addresses)[NextHow to tokenize IPTs from an IP-NFT?](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/how-to-fractionalize-an-ip-nft)\nLast updated 1 month ago\n",

    "markdown": "Copy\n  1. [🧑‍🔬IP Tokens](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens)\n\n\n#  ⚖️What are risks of IP-NFTs and IPTs?\nIP-NFTs and their IPTs merge two different fields of risk: traditional IP risk and all of the risks that come with experimentation using blockchain technology.\n## \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-risks-of-ip-nfts#risks-of-control)\nRisks of Control\nA classic risk for traditional IP, both because of inefficient default IP laws as well as jurisdictional conflict of laws, is risk of dispute over control. We strongly recommend that you have a clear understanding of who controls any piece of IP that you want to mint into an IP-NFT. \nOne way to mitigate this risk is to transfer to the IP-NFT into a single legal entity co-managed by several people, e.g. a Series LLC minted on [Wrappr](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/www.wrappr.wtf). By using a wrapper corporation that sets forth clear terms and conditions regarding IP control and housing the IP in an IP-NFT, many of the traditional risks of IP control can be avoided. \nAnother way to mitigate this risk is to mint IPTs from the IP-NFT using our [model FAM agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mWC_8Q0pfKP0zSjvG09JFbI0W5DHLDqySmjNz2lURY/edit), distributing control to a group of members in an IP commons, an approach we designed for the future of DeSci and described in the \"What are FAM?\" section of these docs. \n## \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-risks-of-ip-nfts#risks-of-daos)\nRisks of DAOs\nThere is risk stemming from regulatory uncertainty as applies to DAOs. For example, are DAOs general partnerships? Is there a way to limit personal liability from the risks involved in participating in a DAO? Is holding an IP-NFT in a DAO impute liability to DAO token holders?\nThese risks can be mitigated by using liability-limitation devices called DAO wrappers. Entities like [Otoco](https://otoco.io/) or [Wrappr](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/www.wrappr.wtf) are experimenting with ways to limit liability for crypto wallet holders, such as minting Series LLCs or UNAs to DAO wallets, and funds like a16z provide guidelines on [DAO features and entity selection](https://a16z.com/2022/05/23/dao-legal-frameworks-entity-features-selection/). \n## \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/what-are-risks-of-ip-nfts#risks-of-securities)\nRisks of Securities\nThere is a risk that IP-NFTs or their IPTs, if sold in a certain way, could be considered securities. \nAn excellent analysis of securities laws as they apply to tokens can be found here, in [The Ineleuctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets are Not Securities](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4282385), by DLx Law. A major takeaway from it is this: there is a difference between the asset itself, e.g. a fungible crypto token or an orange grove and the offering or sale of that asset. The asset, whether a token or an orange grove, may not be a security, but the offering, whether an initial coin offering (ICO) or an advertisement for shares of future profits from the orange grove, likely is a security. \nIn the USA and EU, securities offerings are subject to disclosure rules and procedural requirements depending on the size of the offerings and the kinds of people who can participate in them. These rules are not hard to follow, so you should learn about them and follow them when and where needed in order to mitigate risk. \nTo learn about the rules and guidelines for securities compliance in the USA, EU, or any particular country, consult a local lawyer in that country before selling any tokens there. \n[PreviousHow to buy or trade IPTs](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-tokens/how-to-buy-or-trade-ipts)[NextMIRA](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/mira/mira)\nLast updated 2 years ago\n",

    "markdown": "Copy\n  1. [IP-NFTs](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts)\n\n\n#  ❓Why mint an IP-NFT?\nA researcher, biotech company, or research sponsor mints an IP-NFT to tokenize their IP and research data on Ethereum.\n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/why-mint-an-ip-nft#novel-funding-opportunities)\n**Novel Funding Opportunities**\nIP-NFTs present a fresh pathway for researchers to receive funding, specifically useful for researchers focusing on diseases affecting people worldwide, or diseases not funded by traditional funding mechanisms (NIH, venture capital, etc.). \nTraditionally, funding research is a laborious process involving bureaucratic organizations and/or length legal negotiations, limited to investors or philanthropists in one's personal network and jurisdiction. In contrast, raising research funding via IP-NFTs provides access to an internet-native, globally-sourced capital pool, with the click of a few buttons. \nNo more waiting for months to hear back from bureaucratic organizations who only fund projects that fit their biases, no more pulling out of term sheets at the last second by investors, just execution of instantaneous and immutable smart contracts. Researchers can leverage the global interest of patients and related stakeholders to continue their work, execute on the highest impact (not the most likely to get funded), and create a global community of supporters. \n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/why-mint-an-ip-nft#streamlining-collaboration)\n**Streamlining Collaboration**\nUtilizing IP-NFTs introduces a well-coordinated method for the supervision and transference of both IP and R&D data rights, fostering a platform for productive scientific collaboration. IP-NFTs intrinsically carry legal rights, and ensure those rights are seamlessly linked with the tokens throughout any exchanges. This consolidation of data rights generates aligned incentives and trustless collaboration between among scientific communities. With faster exchange of incentives, scientific collaboration can move at the speed of information. \nWith an on-chain record of ownership and management details, IP-NFTs can significantly streamline due diligence in IP licensing. The transparency and immutability of blockchain records can drive down the costs and complexities of confirming patent holders, tracking licensees, and researching prior valuations, bypassing the need for intermediaries. No more fear over another scientist stealing your ideas, just building on top of others' ideas with a ledger of record of attribution and value. \n### \n[](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/why-mint-an-ip-nft#creation-of-new-ip-markets-and-integration-with-defi)\n**Creation of New IP Markets and Integration with DeFi**\nIP-NFTs can dramatically enhance liquidity in typically stagnant IP markets, traditionally bogged down by complex legal processes standing in the way of collaboration and IP exchange. IP-NFTs provide a straightforward, transparent platform for the exchange and consolidation of IP assets, offering a stark contrast to traditional, labor-intensive transactions. This seamless on-chain mechanism can fundamentally transform how IP transactions are conducted.\nIP-NFTs enable the development of early-stage IP markets. By bundling potential IP from an upcoming R&D project into an early-stage IP-NFT, researchers can trade IP rights more efficiently, even before incurring the costs associated with filing patent protections. As a project progresses, late-stage IP-NFTs can encapsulate rights to trade secrets and patents, introducing innovative mechanisms for decentralized IP ownership, governance, and commercialization.\nThrough their compatibility with decentralized finance (DeFi) components, IP-NFTs can be integrated with other digital assets and software components. They also contribute to the growth of 'DeSci', the decentralized science movement. While still in its early stages, DeSci has the potential to revolutionize scientific collaboration and research, potentially involving billions of participants globally.\nMinting an IP-NFT thus represents an exciting evolution in the management and commercialization of IP and R&D data, offering benefits from improved transparency and efficiency to novel funding and market creation opportunities.\n[PreviousIP-NFT legal structure](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/ip-nft-legal-structure)[NextHow to mint an IP-NFT?](https://docs.molecule.to/documentation/ip-nfts/how-to-mint-an-ip-nft)\nLast updated 1 year ago\n",
